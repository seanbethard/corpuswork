Optical fiber networks. People will be hooked to an information channel
that can be used for any medium-for the first time in history, or for its
end. Once movies and music, phone calls and texts reach households via
optical fiber cables, the formerly distinct media of television, radio, tele­
phone, and mail converge, standardized by transmission frequencies and
bit format. The optoelectronic channel in particular will be immune to
disturbances that might randomize the pretty bit patterns behind the im­
ages and sounds. Immune, that is, to the bomb. As is well known, nuclear
blasts send an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) through the usual copper ca­
bles, which would infect all connected computers.
The Pentagon is engaged in farsighted planning: only the substitution
of optical fibers for metal cables can accommodate the enormous rates
and volumes of bits required, spent, and celebrated by electronic warfare.
All early warning systems, radar installations, missile bases, and army
staffs in Europe, the opposite coast,l finally will be connected to comput­
ers safe from EMP and thus will remain operational in wartime. In the
meantime, pleasure is produced as a by-product: people are free to chan­
nel-surf among entertainment media. After all, fiber optics transmit all
messages imaginable save for the one that counts-the bomb.
Before the end, something is coming to an end. The general digitiza­
tion of channels and information erases the differences among individual
media. Sound and image, voice and text are reduced to surface effects,
known to consumers as interface. Sense and the senses turn into eyewash.
Their media-produced glamor will survive for an interim as a by-product
of strategic programs. Inside the computers themselves everything be­
comes a number: quantity without image, sound, or voice. And once op­
tical fiber networks turn formerly distinct data flows into a standardized

series of digitized numbers, any medium can be translated into any other.
With numbers, everything goes. Modulation, transformation, synchro­
nization; delay, storage, transposition; scrambling, scanning, mapping­
a total media link on a digital base will erase the very concept of medium.
Instead of wiring people and technologies, absolute knowledge will run
as an endless loop.
But there still are media; there still is entertainment.
Today's standard comprises partially connected media links that are
still comprehensible in McLuhan's terms. According to him, one me­
dium's content is always other media: film and radio constitute the con­
tent of television; records and tapes the content of radio; silent films and
audiotape that of cinema; text, telephone, and telegram that of the
semi-media monopoly of the postal system. Since the beginning of the
century, when the electronic tube was developed by von Lieben in Ger­
many and De Forest in California, it has been possible to amplify and
transmit signals. Accordingly, the large media networks, which have been
in existence since the thirties, have been able to fall back on all three stor­
age media-writing, film, and photography-to link up and send their
signals at will.
But these links are separated by incompatible data channels and dif­
fering data formats . Electrics does not equal electronics. Within the spec­
trum of the general data flow, television, radio, cinema, and the postal
service constitute individual and limited windows for people's sense per­
ceptions. Infrared radiations or the radio echoes of approaching missiles
are still transmitted through other channels, unlike the optical fiber net­
works of the future. Our media systems merely distribute the words,
noises, and images people can transmit and receive. But they do not com­
pute these data. They do not produce an output that, under computer
control, transforms any algorithm into any interface effect, to the point
where people take leave of their senses. At this point, the only thing being
computed is the transmission quality of storage media, which appear in
the media links as the content of the media. A compromise between engi­
neers and salespeople regulates how poor the sound from a TV set can be,
how fuzzy movie images can be, or how much a beloved voice on the tele­
phone can be filtered. Our sense perceptions are the dependent variable
of this compromise.
A composite of face and voice that remains calm, even when faced
during a televised debate by an opponent named Richard M. Nixon, is
deemed telegenic and may win a presidential election, as in Kennedy'sIntroduction

case. Voices that an optical close-up would reveal as treacherous, how­
ever, are called radiogenic and rule over the VE 301, the Volksempfanger
of the Second World War. For, as the Heidegger disciple among Ger­
many's early radio experts realized, " death is primarily a radio topic. "2
But these sense perceptions had to be fabricated first. For media to
link up and achieve dominance, we need a coincidence in the Lacanian
sense: that something ceases not to write itself. Prior to the electrification
of media, and well before their electronic end, there were modest, merely
mechanical apparatuses. Unable to amplify or transmit, they nevertheless
were the first to store sensory data: silent movies stored sights, and Edi­
son's phonograph (which, unlike Berliner's later gramophone, was capa­
ble both of recording and reproducing) stored sounds.
On December 6, 1 877, Edison, lord of the first research laboratory in
the history of technology, presented the prototype of the phonograph to
the public. On February 20, 1 892, the same lab in Menlo Park (near New
York) added the so-called kinetoscope. Three years later, the Lumiere
brothers in France and the Skladanowsky brothers in Germany merely
had to add a means of projection to turn Edison's invention into cinema.
Ever since that epochal change we have been in possession of storage
technologies that can record and reproduce the very time flow of acoustic
and optical data. Ears and eyes have become autonomous. And that
changed the state of reality more than lithography and photography,
which (according to Benjamin's thesis) in the first third of the nineteenth
century merely propelled the work of art into the age of its technical re­
producibility. Media " define what really is" ;3 they are always already be­
yond aesthetics.
What phonographs and cinematographs, whose names not coinci­
dentally derive from writing, were able to store was time: time as a mix­
ture of audio frequencies in the acoustic realm and as the movement of
single-image sequences in the optical. Time determines the limit of all art,
which first has to arrest the daily data flow in order to turn it into images
or signs. What is called style in art is merely the switchboard of these
scannings and selections. That same switchboard also controls those arts
that use writing as a serial, that is, temporally transposed, data flow. To
record the sound sequences of speech, literature has to arrest them in a
system of 26 letters, thereby categorically excluding all noise sequences.
Not coincidentally, this system also contains as a subsystem the seven
notes, whose diatonics-from A to G -form the basis of occidental mu­
sic. Following a suggestion made by the musicologist von Hornbostel, it is
possible to fix the chaos of exotic music assailing European ears by first4

interpolating a phonograph, which is able to record this chaos in real time
and then replay it in slow motion. As the rhythms begin to flag and "in­
dividual measures, even individual notes resound on their own, " occi­
dental alphabetism with its staffs can proceed to an "exact notation."4
Texts and scores-Europe had no other means of storing time. Both
are based on a writing system whose time is (in Lacan's term) symbolic.
Using projections and retrievals, this time memorizes itself-like a chain
of chains. Nevertheless, whatever ran as time on a physical or (again in
Lacan's terms) real level, blindly and unpredictably, could by no means be
encoded. Therefore, all data flows, provided they really were streams of
data, had to pass through the bottleneck of the signifier. Alphabetic mo­
nopoly, grammatology.
If the film called history rewinds itself, it turns into an endless loop.
What will soon end in the monopoly of bits and fiber optics began with
the monopoly of writing. History was the homogenized field that, as an
academic subject, only took account of literate cultures. Mouths and
graphisms were relegated to prehistory. Otherwise, stories and histories
(both deriving from historia) could not have been linked. All the orders
and judgments, announcements and prescriptions (military and legal, re­
ligious and medical) that produced mountains of corpses were communi­
cated along the very same channel that monopolized the descriptions ofIntroduction

those mountains of corpses. Which is why anything that ever happened
ended up in libraries.
And Foucault, the last historian or first archeologist, merely had to
look things up. The suspicion that all power emanates from and returns
to archives could be brilliantly confirmed, at least within the realms of
law, medicine, and theology. A tautology of history, or its calvary. For the
libraries in which the archeologist found so much rich material collected
and catalogued papers that had been extremely diverse in terms of ad­
dressee, distribution technique, degree of secrecy, and writing technique­
Foucault's archive as the entropy of a post office.5 Even writing itself, be­
fore it ends up in libraries, is a communication medium, the technology of
which the archeologist simply forgot. It is for this reason that all his
analyses end immediately before that point in time at which other media
penetrated the library's stacks. Discourse analysis cannot be applied to
sound archives or towers of film rolls.
As long as it was moving along, history was indeed Foucault's "wave­
like succession of words."6 More simply, but no less technically than to­
morrow's fiber optic cables, writing functioned as a universal medium-6

i n times when there was no concept o f medium. Whatever else was going
on dropped through the filter of letters or ideograms.
"Literature, " Goethe wrote, " is a fragment of fragments; only the
smallest proportion of what took place and what was said was written
down, while only the smallest proportion of what was written down has
survived. " 7
Accordingly, oral history today confronts the historians' writing mo­
nopoly; accordingly, a media theoretician like the Jesuit priest Walter J.
Ong, who must have been concerned with the spirit of the Pentecostal
mystery, could celebrate a primary orality of tribal cultures as opposed to
the secondary orality of our media acoustics. Such research remained un­
thinkable as long as the opposite of " history" was simply termed (againIntroduction
7
following Goethe) "legend."s Prehistory was subsumed by its mythical
name; Goethe's definition of literature did not even have to mention opti­
cal or acoustic data flows. And even legends, those oralized segments of
bygone events, only survived in written format; that is, under pretechno­
logical but literary conditions. However, since it has become possible to
record the epics of the last Homeric bards, who until recently were wan­
dering through Serbia and Croatia, oral mnemotechnics or cultures have
become reconstructible in a completely different way.9 Even Homer's
rosy-fingered Eos changes from a Goddess into a piece of chromium diox­
ide that was stored in the memory of the bard and could be combined
with other pieces into whole epics. "Primary orality" and " oral history"
came into existence only after the end of the writing monopoly, as the
technological shadows of the apparatuses that document them.
Writing, however, stored writing-no more and no less. The holy books
attest to this. Exodus, chapter 20, contains a copy of what Yahweh's own
finger originally had written on two stone tablets: the law. But of the
thunder and lightning, of the thick cloud and the mighty trumpet which,
according to scripture, surrounded this first act of writing on Mount
Sinai, that same Bible could store nothing but mere words.lo
Even less is handed down of the nightmares and temptations that af­
flicted a nomad called Mohammed following his flight to the holy moun­
tain of Hira. The Koran does not begin until the one God takes the place
of the many demons. The archangel Gabriel descends from the seventh
heaven with a roll of scripture and the command to decipher the scroll.
" Rejoice in the name of the Lord who created-created man from clots
of blood. Recite! Your Lord is the Most Bountiful One, who by pen
taught man what he did not know. " l l
Mohammed, however, answers that he, the nomad, can't read; not
even the divine message about the origin of reading and writing. The
archangel has to repeat his command before an illiterate can turn into the
founder of a book-based religion. For soon, or all too soon, the illegible
scroll makes sense and presents to Mohammed's miraculously alphabet­
ized eyes the very same text that Gabriel had already uttered twice as an
oral command. Mohammed's illuminations began, according to tradition,
with this 9 6th sura-in order then to be "memorized by the faithful and
written down on primitive surfaces such as palm leaves, stones, wood,
bones, and pieces of leather, and to be recited, again and again, by Mo­
hammed and select believers, especially during Ramadan. " 12
Writing therefore merely stores the fact of its authorization. It cele-8
Introduction
brates the storage monopoly of the God who invented it. And since the
realm of this God consists of signs that only nonreaders can't make sense
of, all books are books of the dead, like the Egyptian ones with which lit­
erature began.13 The book itself coincides with the realm of the dead be­
yond all senses into which it lures us. When the Stoic philosopher Zeno
asked the oracle at Delphi how he should best lead his life, he was given
the answer "that he should mate with the dead. He understood this to
mean that he should read the ancients." 1 4
The story of how the divine instructions to use quills extended be­
yond Moses and Mohammed and reached simpler and simpler people is a
lengthy one that nobody can write, because it would be history itself. In
much the same way, the storage capacities of our computers will soon co­
incide with electronic warfare and, gigabyte upon gigabyte, exceed all the
processing capacities of historians.
Suffice it to say that one day-in Germany, this may have already
been the case during the age of Goethe-the homogenous medium of
writing also became homogenous in the social sphere. Compulsory edu­
cation engulfed people in paper. They learned a way of writing that, as an
" abuse of language" ( according to Goethe), no longer had to struggle
with cramped muscles and individual letters, but rather proceeded in rap­
ture or darkness. They learned to read " silently to one's self, " a " sorry
substitute for speech " ls that consumed letters without effort by bypassing
oral organs. Whatever they emitted and received was writing. And be­
cause only that exists which can be posted, bodies themselves fell under
the regime of the symbolic. What is unthinkable today was once reality:
no film stored the movements they made or saw, no phonograph, the
noise they made or heard. For whatever existed failed before time. Sil­
houettes or pastel drawings fixed facial expressions, and scores were un­
able to store noise. But once a hand took hold of a pen, something mirac­
ulous occurred: the body, which did not cease not to write itself, left
strangely unavoidable traces.
I'm ashamed to tell of it. I'm ashamed of my handwriting. It exposes me in all
my spiritual nakedness. My handwriting shows me more naked than I am with
my clothes off. No leg, no breath, no clothes, no sound. Neither voice nor reflec­
tion. All cleaned out. Instead, a whole man's being, shriveled and misshapen,
like his scribble-scrabble. His lines are all that's left of him, as well as his self­
propagation. The uneven tracings of his pencil on paper, so minimal that a blind
man's fingertips would hardly detect them, become the measure of the whole
fellow. 1 6Introduction
9
Today, this shame, which overcomes the hero of Botho Strauss's last love
story, Dedication, whenever he sees his handwriting, is no more than an
anachronism. The fact that the minimal unevenness between stroke and
paper can store neither a voice nor an image of a body presupposes in its
exclusion the invention of phonography and cinema. Before their inven­
tion, however, handwriting alone could guarantee the perfect securing of
traces. It wrote and wrote, in an energetic and ideally uninterrupted flow.
As Hegel so correctly observed, the alphabetized individual had his "ap­
pearance and externality" 17 in this continuous flow of ink or letters.
And what applied to writing also applied to reading. Even if the al­
phabetized individual known as the "author" finally had to fall from the
private exteriority of handwriting into the anonymous exteriority of print
in order to secure "all that's left of him, as well as his self-propagation"­
alphabetized individuals known as "readers" were able to reverse this ex­
teriorization. "If one reads in the right way, " Novalis wrote, "the words
will unfold in us a real, visible world. " 1 8 And his friend Schlegel added
that " one believes to hear what one merely reads."19 Perfect alphabetiza­
tion was to supplement precisely those optical and acoustic data flows
that, under the monopoly of writing, did not cease not to write them­
selves. Effort had been removed from writing, and sound from reading, in
order to naturalize writing. The letters that educated readers skimmed
over provided people with sights and sounds.
Aided by compulsory education and new alphabetization techniques,
the book became both film and record around 1 8oo-not as a media­
technological reality, but in the imaginary of readers' souls. As a surro­
gate of unstorable data flows, books came to power and glory. 20
In 1 774 an editor by the name of Goethe committed handwritten let­
ters or Sorrows of Young Werther to print. The "nameless throng" (to
quote the dedication of Faust), too, was to hear an "early song" that, like
" some old half-faded song," revived "old griefs " and " old friends. " 21
This was the new literary recipe for success: to surreptitiously turn the
voice or handwriting of a soul into Gutenbergiana. In the last letter he
wrote and sealed but did not send off before committing suicide, Werther
gave his beloved the very promise of poetry: during her lifetime she would
have to remain with Albert, her unloved husband, but afterwards she
would be united with her lover " in the sight of the Infinite One in eternal
embraces." 22 Indeed: the addressee of handwritten love letters, which
were then published by a mere editor, was to be rewarded with an im­
mortality in the shape of the novel itself. It alone was able to create the10
Introduction
"beautiful realm" 23 in which the lovers of Goethe's Elective Affinities, ac­
cording to the hope of their narrator, "will waken together once more. "24
Strangely enough, Eduard and Ottilie had one and the same handwriting
during their lifetime. Their death elevated them to a paradise that under
the storage monopoly of writing was called poetry.
And maybe that paradise was more real than our media-controlled
senses can imagine. Reading intently, Werther's suicidal readers may well
have perceived their hero in a real, visible world. And the lovers among
Goethe's female readers, like Bettina Brentano, may well have died with
the heroine of his Elective Affinities only to be " reborn in a more beauti­
ful youth" through Goethe's "genius. "2s Maybe the perfectly alphabetized
readers of 1 800 were a living answer to the question with which Chris
Marker concludes his film essay Sans Soleil:
Lost at the end of the world on my island, Sal, in the company of my dogs strut­
ting around, I remember that January in Tokyo, or rather I remember the images
I filmed in Tokyo in January. They have now put themselves in place of my mem­
ory, they are my memory. I wonder how people who do not film, take photos, or
record tapes remember, how humankind used to go about remembering.2 6
It is the same with language, which only leaves us the choice of either
retaining words while losing their meaning or, vice versa, retaining mean­
ing while losing the wordsY Once storage media can accommodate opti­
cal and acoustic data, human memory capacity is bound to dwindle. Its
"liberation"28 is its end. As long as the book was responsible for all serial
data flows, words quivered with sensuality and memory. It was the passion
of all reading to hallucinate meaning between lines and letters: the visible_
and audible world of Romantic poetics. And the passion of all writing was
(in the words of E. T. A. Hoffmann) the poet's desire to "describe" the hal­
lucinated "picture in one's mind with all its vivid colors, the light and the
shade, " in order to "strike [the] gentle reader like an electric shock. " 29
Electricity itself put an end to this. Once memories and dreams, the dead
and ghosts, become technically reproducible, readers and writers no
longer need the powers of hallucination. Our realm of the dead has with­
drawn from the books in which it resided for so long. As Diodor of Sicily
once wrote, "it is no longer only through writing that the dead remain in
the memory of the living. "
The writer Balzac was already overcome b y fear when faced with
photography, as he confessed to Nadar, the great pioneer of photography.
If (according to Balzac) the human body consists of many infinitely thinIntroduction

layers of "specters," and if the human spirit cannot be created from noth­
ingness, then the daguerreotype must be a sinister trick: it fixes, that is,
steals, one layer after the other, until nothing remains of the specters and
the photographed body.30 Photo albums establish a realm of the dead in­
finitely more precise than Balzac's competing literary enterprise, the Co­
medie humaine, could ever hope to create. In contrast to the arts, media
do not have to make do with the grid of the symbolic. That is to say, they
reconstruct bodies not only in a system of words or colors or sound in­
tervals. Media and media only fulfill the "high standards " that (accord­
ing to Rudolf Arnheim) we expect from " reproductions" since the inven­
tion of photography: "They are not only supposed to resemble the object,r2
Introduction
but rather guarantee this resemblance by being, as it were, a product of
the object in question, that is, by being mechanically produced by it-just
as the illuminated obj ects of reality imprint their image on the photo­
graphic layer, "31 or the frequency curves of noises inscribe their wavelike
shapes onto the phonographic plate.
A reproduction authenticated by the object itself is one of physical
precision. It refers to the bodily real, which of necessity escapes all sym­
bolic grids. Media always already provide the appearances of specters.
For, according to Lacan, even the word " corpse" is a euphemism in ref­
erence to the real. 3 2
Accordingly, the invention of the Morse alphabet in r 837 was
promptly followed by the tapping specters of spiritistic seances sending
their messages from the realm of the dead. Promptly as well, photo­
graphic plates- even and especially those taken with the camera shutter
closed-furnished reproductions of ghosts or specters, whose black-and­
white fuzziness only served to underscore the promise of resemblance. Fi­
nally, one of the ten applications Edison envisioned for his newly invented
phonograph in the North American Review ( r 8 7 8 ) was to record "the
last words of dying persons. "
It was only a small step from such a " family record, "33 with its spe­
cial consideration of revenants, to fantasies that had telephone cables
linking the living and the dead. What Leopold Bloom in Ulysses could
only wish for in his Dublin graveyard meditations had already been
turned into science fiction by Walter Rathenau, the AEG chairman of the
board and futurist writer.34 In Rathenau's story "Resurrection Co. , " the
cemetery administration of Necropolis, Dacota/USA, following a series
of scandalous premature burials in r 898, founds a daughter company en­
titled "Dacota and Central Resurrection Telephone Bell Co. " with a cap-­
ital stock of $750,000. Its sole purpose is to make certain that the inhab­
itants of graves, too, are connected to the public telephone network .
Whereupon the dead avail themselves of the opportunity to prove, long
before McLuhan, that the content of one medium is always another me­
dium-in this concrete case, a deformation professionelle.35
These days, paranormal voices on tape or radio, the likes of which
have been spiritistically researched since r959 and preserved in rock mu­
sic since Laurie Anderson's r98 2 release Big Science,36 inform their re­
searchers of their preferred radio wavelength. This already occurred
in r 898, in the case of Senate President Schreber: when a paranormal,
beautifully autonomous " base or nerve language" revealed its code as
well as its channels,37 message and channel became one. " You just have toIntroduction
13
choose a middle-, short-, o r long-wave talk-show station, o r the 'white
noise' between two stations, or the 'Jurgenson wave,' which, depending
on where you are, is located around 1 4 5 0 to 1600 kHz between Vienna
and Moscow. "3 8 If you replay a tape that has been recorded off the radio,
you will hear all kinds of ghost voices that do not originate from any
known radio station, but that, like all official newscasters, indulge in ra­
dio self-advertisement. Indeed, the location and existence of that "Jiir­
genson wave" was pinpointed by none other than "Friedrich Jurgenson,
the Nestor of vocal research."39
The realm of the dead is as extensive as the storage and transmission
capabilities of a given culture. As Klaus Theweleit noted, media are al­
ways flight apparatuses into the great beyond. If gravestones stood as
symbols at the beginning of culture itself, our media technology can re­
trieve all gods. The old written laments about ephemerality, which mea­
sured no more than distance between writing and sensuality, suddenly fall
silent. In our mediascape, immortals have come to exist again.
War on the Mind is the title of an account of the psychological strate­
gies hatched by the Pentagon. It reports that the staffs planning the elec­
tronic war, which merely continues the Battle of the Atlantic,40 have
already compiled a list of the propitious and unpropitious days in other
cultures. This list enables the u.s. Air Force "to time [its] bombing cam­
paigns to coincide with unpropitious days, thus 'confirming' the forecasts
of local gods . " As well, the voices of these gods have been recorded on
tape to be broadcast from helicopters "to keep tribes in their villages. "
And finally, the Pentagon has developed special film projectors capable of
projecting those gods onto low-hanging clouds.41 A technologically im­
plemented beyond . . .
Of course the Pentagon does not keep a handwritten list of good and bad
days. Office technology keeps up with media technology. Cinema and the
phonograph, Edison's two great achievements that ushered in the present,
are complemented by the typewriter. Since 1 8 65 (according to European
accounts) or 1 8 68 (according to American ones), writing has no longer
been the ink or pencil trace of a body whose optical and acoustic signals
were irretrievably lost, only to reappear (in readers' minds) in the surro­
gate sensuality of handwriting. In order to store series of sights and
sounds, Old Europe's only storage technology first had to be mechanized.
Hans Magnus Malling Hansen in Copenhagen and Christopher Latham
Sholes in Milwaukee developed mass-producible typewriters. Edison com­
mented positively on the invention's potential when Sholes visited him in14
Introduction
Newark to demonstrate his newly patented model and to invite the man
who had invented invention to enter a j oint venture.42
But Edison declined the offer-as if, already in r 8 6 8 , the phono­
graph and kinetoscope preoccupied their future inventor. Instead, the of­
fer was grabbed by an arms manufacturer suffering from dwindling rev­
enues in the post-Civil War slump. Remington, not Edison, took over
Sholes's discourse machine gun.
Thus, there was no Marvelous One from whose brow sprang all three
media technologies of the modern age. On the contrary, the beginning of
our age was marked by separation or differentiation.43 On the one hand,
we have two technological media that, for the first time, fix unwritable
data flows; on the other, an " 'intermediate' thing between a tool and a
machine," as Heidegger wrote so precisely about the typewriter.44 On the
one hand, we have the entertainment industry with its new sensualities;
on the other, a writing that already separates paper and body during tex­
tual production, not first during reproduction (as Gutenberg's movable
types had done) . From the beginning, the letters and their arrangement
were standardized in the shapes of type and keyboard, while media were
engulfed by the noise of the real-the fuzziness of cinematic pictures, the
hissing of tape recordings.
In standardized texts, paper and body, writing and soul fall apart.
Typewriters do not store individuals; their letters do not communicate a
beyond that perfectly alphabetized readers can subsequently hallucinate
as meaning. Everything that has been taken over by technological media
since Edison's inventions disappears from typescripts. The dream of a real
visible or audible world arising from words has come to an end. The his­
torical synchronicity of cinema, phonography, and typewriting separated
optical, acoustic, and written data flows, thereby rendering them au­
tonomous. That electric or electronic media can recombine them does not
change the fact of their differentiation.
In r 8 60, five years before MaIling Hansen's mechanical writing ball
(the first mass-produced typewriter), Gottfried Keller's "Misused Love
Letters" still proclaimed the illusion of poetry itself: love is left with the
impossible alternatives of speaking either with " black ink" or with "red
blood. "45 But once typing, filming, and recording became equally valid
options, writing lost such surrogate sensualities. Around 1 8 8 0 poetry
turned into literature. Standardized letters were no longer to transmit
Keller's red blood or Hoffmann's inner forms, but rather a new and ele­
gant tautology of technicians. According to Mallarme's instant insight, lit­
erature is made up of no more and no less than twenty-six letters.46Introduction
15
Lacan's "methodological distinction "47 among the real, the imagi­
nary, and the symbolic is the theory (or merely a historical effect) of that
differentiation. The symbolic now encompasses linguistic signs in their
materiality and technicity. That is to say, letters and ciphers form a finite
set without taking into account philosophical dreams of infinity. What
counts are differences, or, in the language of the typewriter, the spaces be­
tween the elements of a system. For that reason, Lacan designates "the
world of the symbolic [as 1 the world of the machine. "48
The imaginary, however, comes about as the mirror image of a body
that appears to be, in terms of motor control, more perfect than the in­
fant's own body, for in the real everything begins with coldness, dizziness,
and shortness of breathY Thus, the imaginary implements precisely those
optical illusions that were being researched in the early days of cinema.
A dismembered or (in the case of film) cut-up body is faced with the illu­
sionary continuity of movements in the mirror or on screen. It is no coin­
cidence that Lacan recorded infants' jubilant reactions to their mirror im­

Lacan presupposed-that is, nothing. It forms the waste or residue thatr6
Introduction
neither the mirror of the imaginary nor the grid of the symbolic can
catch: the physiological accidents and stochastic disorder of bodies.
The methodological distinctions of modern psychoanalysis clearly co­
incide with the distinctions of media technology. Every theory has its his­
torical a priori. And structuralist theory simply spells out what, since the
turn of the century, has been coming over the information channels.
Only the typewriter provides writing as a selection from the finite
and arranged stock of its keyboard. It literally embodies what Lacan
illustrated using the antiquated letter box. In contrast to the flow of
handwriting, we now have discrete elements separated by spaces. Thus,
the symbolic has the status of block letters. Film was the first to store
those mobile doubles that humans, unlike other primates, were able to
(mis)perceive as their own body. Thus, the imaginary has the status of
cinema. And only the phonograph can record all the noise produced by
the larynx prior to any semiotic order and linguistic meaning. To experi­
ence pleasure, Freud's patients no longer have to desire what philosophers
consider good. Rather, they are free to babble.50 Thus, the real-espe­
cially in the talking cure known as psychoanalysis-has the status of
phonography.
Once the technological differentiation of optics, acoustics, and writ­
ing exploded Gutenberg's writing monopoly around r 8 80, the fabrication
of so-called Man became possible. His essence escapes into apparatuses.
Machines take over functions of the central nervous system, and no
longer, as in times past, merely those of muscles. And with this differenti­
ation-and not with steam engines and railroads-a clear division occurs
between matter and information, the real and the symbolic. When it
comes to inventing phonography and cinema, the age-old dreams of hu­
mankind are no longer sufficient. The physiology of eyes, ears, and brains
have to become objects of scientific research. For mechanized writing to
be optimized, one can no longer dream of writing as the expression of in­
dividuals or the trace of bodies. The very forms, differences, and fre­
quencies of its letters have to be reduced to formulas. So-called Man is
split up into physiology and information technology.
When Hegel summed up the perfect alphabetism of his age, he called
it Spirit. The readability of all history and all discourses turned humans
or philosophers into God. The media revolution of r 8 80, however, laid
the groundwork for theories and practices that no longer mistake infor­
mation for spirit. Thought is replaced by a Boolean algebra, and con­
sciousness by the unconscious, which (at least since Lacan's reading)
makes of Poe's "Purloined Letter" a Markoff chain.51 And that the sym-Introduction
17
bolic is called the world of the machine undermines Man's delusion of
possessing a " quality" called "consciousness," which identifies him as
something other and better than a " calculating machine. " For both peo­
ple and computers are " subject to the appeal of the signifier"; that is, they
are both run by programs. "Are these humans, " Nietzsche already asked
himself in 1 8 74, eight years before buying a typewriter, "or perhaps only
thinking, writing, and speaking machines ? " 52
In 1950 Alan Turing, the practitioner among England's mathematicians,
gave the answer to Nietzsche's question. He observed, with formal ele­
gance, that there is no question to begin with. To clarify the issue, Tur­
ing's essay " Computing Machinery and Intelligence"-appearing in, of
all places, the philosophical periodical Mind-proposed an experiment,
the so-called Turing game: A computer A and human B exchange data via
some kind of telewriter interface. The exchange of texts is monitored by a
censor C, who also only receives written information. A and B both pre­
tend to be human, and C has to decide which of the two is simulating and
which merely is Nietzsche's thinking, writing, and speaking machine. But
the game remains open-ended, because each time the machine gives itself
away-be it by making a mistake or, more likely, by not making any-it
will refine its program by learning. 53 In the Turing game, Man coincides
with his simulation.
And this is, obviously, already so because the censor C receives plot­
ter printouts and typescripts rather than handwritten texts. Of course,
computer programs could simulate the " individuality" of the human
hand, with its routines and mistakes, but Turing, as the inventor of the
universal discrete machine, was a typist. Though he wasn't much better
or skilled at it than his tomcat Timothy, who was allowed to jump across
the keyboard in Turing's chaotic secret service office,54 it was at least
somewhat less catastrophic than his handwriting. The teachers at the
honorable Sherborne School could hardly "forgive" their pupil's chaotic
lifestyle and messy writing. He got lousy grades for brilliant exams
in mathematics only because his handwriting was "the worst . . . ever
seen. "55 Faithfully, schools cling to their old duty of fabricating individu­
als (in the literal sense of the word) by drilling them in a beautiful, con­
tinuous, and individual handwriting. Turing, a master in subverting all
education, however, dodged the system; he made plans for an " exceed­
ingly crude " typewriter. 56
Nothing came of these plans. But when, on the meadows of Grant­
chester, the meadows of all English poetry from the Romantics to Pink18
Introduction
Floyd, he hit upon the idea of the universal discrete machine, his early
dreams were realized and transformed. Sholes's typewriter, reduced to its
fundamental principle, has supported us to this day. Turing merely got rid
of the people and typists that Remington & Son needed for reading and
writing.
And this is possible because a Turing machine is even more exceed­
ingly crude than the Sherborne plan for a typewriter. All it works with is
a paper strip that is both its program and its data material, its input and
its output. Turing slimmed down the common typewriter page to this lit­
tle strip. But there are even more economizations: his machine doesn't
need the many redundant letters, ciphers, and signs of a typewriter key­
board; it can do with one sign and its absence, I and o. This binary in­
formation can be read or (in Turing's technospeak) scanned by the ma­
chine. It can then move the paper strip one space to the right, one to the
left, or not at all, moving in a jerky (i.e., discrete) fashion like a type­
writer, which in contrast to handwriting has block caps, a back spacer,
and a space bar. (From a letter to Turing: "Pardon the use of the type­
writer: I have come to prefer discrete machines to continuous ones . " )57
The mathematical model of 193 6 is no longer a hermaphrodite of a ma­
chine and a mere tool. As a feedback system it beats all the Remingtons,
because each step is controlled by scanning the paper strip for the sign
or its absence, which amounts to a kind of writing: it depends on this
reading whether the machine keeps the sign or erases it, or, vice versa,
whether it keeps a space blank or replaces it with a sign, and so on and
so forth.
That's all. But no computer that has been built or ever will be built
can do more. Even the most advanced Von Neumann machines (with pro­
gram storage and computing units) , though they operate much faster, are
in principle no different from Turing's infinitely slow model. Also, while
not all computers have to be Von Neumann machines, all conceivable
data processing machines are merely a state n of the universal discrete
machine. This was proved mathematically by Alan Turing in 193 6, two
years before Konrad Zuse in Berlin built the first programmable computer
from simple relays. And with that the world of the symbolic really turned
into the world of the machine .58
Unlike the history to which it put an end, the media age proceeds in
jerks, just like Turing's paper strip. From the Remington via the Turing
machine to microelectronics, from mechanization and automatization to
the implementation of a writing that is only cipher, not meaning-one
century was enough to transfer the age-old monopoly of writing into theIntroduction
19
omnipotence of integrated circuits. Not unlike Turing's correspondents,
everyone is deserting analog machines in favor of discrete ones. The CD
digitizes the gramophone, the video camera digitizes the movies. All data
streams flow into a state n of Turing's universal machine; Romanticism
notwithstanding, numbers and figures become the key to all creatures.GRA MOPHONE
"Hullo ! " Edison screamed into the telephone mouthpiece. The vibrating
diaphragm set in motion a stylus that wrote onto a moving strip of paraf­
fin paper. In July 1 877, 8 1 years before Turing's moving paper strip, the
recording was still analog. Upon replaying the strip and its vibrations,
which in turn set in motion the diaphragm, a barely audible "Hullo! "
could be heard.1
Edison understood. A month later he coined a new term for his tele­
phone addition: phonograph. 2 On the basis of this experiment, the me­
chanic Kruesi was given" the assignment to build an apparatus that would
etch acoustic vibrations onto a rotating cylinder covered with tinfoil.
While he or Kruesi was turning the handle, Edison once again screamed "
into the mouthpiece -this time the nursery rhyme "Mary Had a Little
Lamb." Then they moved the needle back, let the cylinder run a second
time-and the first phonograph replayed the screams. The exhausted ge­
nius, in whose phrase genius is I percent inspiration and 99 percent per­
spiration, slumped back. Mechanical sound recording had been invented.
"Speech has become, as it were, immortal."3
It was December 6, 1 877. Eight months earlier, Charles Cros, a Pari­
sian writer, bohemian, inventor, and absinthe drinker, had deposited a
sealed envelope with the Academy of Sciences. It contained an essay on
the "Procedure for the Recording and Reproduction of Phenomena of
Acoustic Perception" (Procede d'enregistrement et de reproduction des
phenom€mes pert;us par !'ouie). With great technological elegance this
text formulated all the principles of the phonograph, but owing to a lack
of funds Cros had not yet been able to bring about its "practical realiza­
tion. " "To reproduce" the traces of "the sounds and noises" that the "to
2122
Gramophone
and fro" of an acoustically "vibrating diaphragm" leaves on a rotating
disk-that was also the program of Charles Cros.4
But once he had been preceded by Edison, who was aware of rumors
of the invention, things sounded different. "Inscription " is the title of the
poem with which Cros erected a belated monument to honor his inven­
tions, which included an automatic telephone, color photography, and,
above all, the phonograph:
Comme les traits dans les camees
J'ai voulu que les voix aimees
Soient un bien qu'on garde a jamais,
Et puissent reperer Ie reve
Musical de I'heure trop breve;
Le temps veut fuir, je Ie soumets.
Like the faces in cameos
I wanted beloved voices
To be a fortune which one keeps forever,
And which can repeat the musical
Dream of the too short hour;
Time would flee, I subdue it. 5
The program of the poet Cros, in his capacity as the inventor of the
phonograph, was to store beloved voices and all-too-brief musical rever­
ies. The wondrously resistant power of writing ensures that the poem has
no words for the truth about competing technologies. Certainly, phono­
graphs can store articulate voices and musical intervals, but they are ca­
pable of more and different things. Cros the poet forgets the noises men­
tioned in his precise prose text. An invention that subverts both literature
and music (because it reproduces the unimaginable real they are both
based on) must have struck even its inventor as something unheard of.
Hence, it was not coincidental that Edison, not Cros, actually built
the phonograph. His "Hullo ! " was no beloved voice and "Mary Had a
Little Lamb" no musical reverie. And he screamed into the bell-mouth
not only because phonographs have no amplifiers but also because Edi­
son, following a youthful adventure involving some conductor's fists, was
half-deaf. A physical impairment was at the beginning of mechanical
sound recording-just as the first typewriters had been made by the blind
for the blind, and Charles Cros had taught at a school for the deaf and
mute.6

dissolve such feedback loops. They await inventors like Edison whom
chance has equipped with a similar dissolution. Handicaps isolate and the­
matize sensory data streams. The phonograph does not hear as do ears that
have been trained immediately to filter voices, words, and sounds out of
noise; it registers acoustic events as such. Articulateness becomes a second­
order exception in a spectrum of noise. In the first phonograph letter of
postal history, Edison wrote that "the articulation" of his baby "was loud
enough, just a bit indistinct . . . not bad for a first experiment. " s
Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk, that monomaniacal anticipation o f mod­
ern media technologies,9 had already transgressed the traditional bound­
aries of words and music to do justice to the unarticulated. In Tristan,
Brangane was allowed to utter a scream whose notation cut straight
through the score.10 Not to mention Parsifal's Kundry, who suffered from
a hysterical speech impairment such as those which were soon to occupy
the psychoanalyst Freud: she " gives a loud wail of misery, that sinks grad­
ually into low accents of fear, " "utters a dreadful cry," and is reduced to
"hoarse and broken," though nonetheless fully composed, garblingY This
labored inception of language has nothing to do with operas and dramas24
Gramophone
that take it for granted that their figures can speak. Composers of 1 8 80,
however, are allied with engineers. The undermining of articulation be­
comes the order of the day.
In Wagner's case this applies to both text and music. The Rhinegold
prelude, with its infinite swelling of a single chord, dissolves the E-flat
major triad in the first horn melody as if it were not a matter of musical
harmony but of demonstrating the physical overtone series. All the har­
monics of E-flat appear one after the other, as if in a Fourier analysis; only
the seventh is missing, because it cannot be played by European instru­
ments. 1 2 Of course, each of the horn sounds is an unavoidable overtone
mixture of the kind only the sine tones of contemporary synthesizers can
avoid. Nevertheless, Wagner's musico-physiological dream13 at the outset
of the tetralogy sounds like a historical transition from intervals to fre­
quencies, from a logic to a physics of sound. By the time Schoenberg, in
19 ro, produced the last analysis of harmony in the history of music,
chords had turned into pure acoustics: " For Schoenberg as well as for sci­
ence, the physical basis in which he is trying to ground all phenomena is
the overtone series. " 14
Overtones are frequencies, that is, vibrations per second. And the
grooves of Edison's phonograph recorded nothing but vibrations. Inter­
vals and chords, by contrast, were ratios, that is, fractions made up of in­
tegers. The length of a string (especially on a monochord) was subdi­
vided, and the fractions, to which Pythagoras gave the proud name logoi,
resulted in octaves, fifths, fourths, and so on. Such was the logic upon
which was founded everything that, in Old Europe, went by the name of
music: first, there was a notation system that enabled the transcription of
clear sounds separated from the world's noise; and second, a harmony of
the spheres that established that the ratios between planetary orbits (later
human souls) equaled those between sounds.
The nineteenth century's concept of frequency breaks with all thisY
The measure of length is replaced by time as an independent variable. It
is a physical time removed from the meters and rhythms of music. It
quantifies movements that are too fast for the human eye, ranging from
20 to 16,000 vibrations per second. The real takes the place of the sym­
bolic. Certainly, references can also be established to link musical inter­
vals and acoustic frequencies, but they only testify to the distance be­
tween two discourses. In frequency curves the simple proportions of
Pythagorean music turn into irrational, that is, logarithmic, functions.
Conversely, overtone series-which in frequency curves are simply inte-Gramophone
25
gral multiples o f vibrations and the determining elements o f each
sound-soon explode the diatonic music system. That is the depth of the
gulf separating Old European alphabetism from mathematical-physical
notation.
Which is why the first frequency notations were developed outside of
music. First noise itself had to become an object of scientific research, and
discourses "a privileged category of noises . " 16 A competition sponsored
by the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1 780 made voiced sounds,
and vowels in particular, an object of research,17 and inaugurated not only
speech physiology but also all the experiments involving mechanical lan­
guage reproduction. Inventors like Kempelen, Maelzel, and Mical built
the first automata that, by stimulating and filtering certain frequency
bands, could simulate the very sounds that Romanticism was simultane­
ously celebrating as the language of the soul: their dolls said "Mama" and
"Papa" or " Oh, " like Hoffmann's beloved automaton, Olympia. Even
Edison's 1 8 78 article on phonography intended such toy mouths voicing26
Gramophone
the parents' names as Christmas presents. I S Removed from all Romanti­
cism, a practical knowledge of vowel frequencies emerged.
Continuing these experiments, Willis made a decisive discovery in
1 8 29. He connected elastic tongues to a cogwheel whose cogs set them vi­
brating. According to the speed of its rotation, high or low sounds were
produced that sounded like the different vowels, thus proving their fre­
quency. For the first time pitch no longer depended on length, as with
string or brass instruments; it became a variable dependent on speed and,
therefore, time. Willis had invented the prototype of all square-curve gen­
erators, ranging from the bold verse-rhythm experiments of the turn of
the century19 to Kontakte, Stockhausen's first electronic composition.
The synthetic production of frequencies is followed by their analysis.
Fourier had already provided the mathematical theory, but that theory
had yet to be implemented technologically. In 1 8 30, Wilhelm Weber in
Gottingen had a tuning fork record its own vibrations. He attached a
pig's bristle to one of the tongues, which etched its frequency curves into
sooty glass. Such were the humble, or animal, origins of our gramophone
needles.
From Weber's writing tuning fork Edouard Leon Scott, who as a
Parisian printer was, not coincidentally, an inhabitant of the Gutenberg
Galaxy, developed his phonautograph, patented in 1 8 57. A bell-mouth
amplified incoming sounds and transmitted them onto a membrane,
which in turn used a coarse bristle to transcribe them onto a soot-covered
cylinder. Thus came into being autographs or handwritings of a data
stream that heretofore had not ceased not to write itself. (Instead, there
was handwriting.) Scott's phonautograph, however, made visible what, up
to this point, had only been audible and had been much too fast for ill-Gramophone
27
equipped human eyes: hundreds of vibrations per second. A triumph of
the concept of frequency: all the whispered or screamed noises people
emitted from their larynxes, with or without dialects, appeared on paper.
Phonetics and speech physiology became a reality. 20
They were especially real in the case of Henry Sweet, whose perfect
English made him the prototype of all experimental phonetics as well as
the hero of a play. Recorded by Professor F. C. Donders of Utrecht,21
Sweet was also dramatized by George Bernard Shaw, who turned him
into a modern Pygmalion out to conquer all mouths that, however beau­
tiful, were marred by dialect. To record and discipline the dreadful dialect
of the flower girl Eliza Doolittle, "Higgins's laboratory" boasts "a phono­
graph, a laryngoscope, [and] a row of tiny organ pipes with a bellows. " 22
In the world of the modern Pygmalion, mirrors and statues are unneces­
sary; sound storage makes it possible "to inspect one's own speech or dis­
course as in a mirror, thus enabling us to adopt a critical stance toward
our products. "23 To the great delight of Shaw, who saw his medium or his
readability technologically guaranteed to all English speakers,24 machines
easily solve a problem that literature had not been able to tackle on its
own, or had only been able to tackle through the mediation of peda­
gogy:2S to drill people in general, and flower girls in particular, to adopt a
pronunciation purified by written language.
It comes as no surprise that Eliza Doolittle, all of her love notwith­
standing, abandons her Pygmalion ( Sweet, a.k.a. Higgins) at the end of
the play in order to learn " bookkeeping and typewriting" at "shorthand
schools and polytechnic classes. "26 Women who have been subjected to
phonographs and typewriters are souls no longer; they can only end up in
musicals. Renaming the drama My Fair Lady, Rodgers and Hammerstein
will throw Shaw's Pygmalion among Broadway tourists and record labels.
"On the Street Where You Live " is sound.
In any event, Edison, ancestor of the record industry, only needed to com­
bine, as is so often the case with inventions. A Willis-type machine gave
him the idea for the phonograph; a Scott-type machine pushed him to­
ward its realization. The synthetic production of frequencies combined
with their analysis resulted in the new medium.
Edison's phonograph was a by-product of the attempt to optimize
telephony and telegraphy by saving expensive copper cables. First, Menlo
Park developed a telegraph that indented a paraffin paper strip with
Morse signs, thus allowing them to be replayed faster than they had been28
Gramophone
transmitted by human hands. The effect was exactly the same as in
Willis's case: pitch became a variable dependent on speed. Second, Menlo
Park developed a telephone receiver with a needle attached to the di­
aphragm. By touching the needle, the hearing-impaired Edison could
check the amplitude of the telephone signal. Legend has it that one day
the needle drew blood-and Edison "recognized how the force of a
membrane moved by a magnetic system could be put to work." "In ef­
fect, he had found a way to transfer the functions of his ear to his sense of
touch. "27
A telegraph as an artificial mouth, a telephone as an artificial ear­
the stage was set for the phonograph. Functions of the central nervous
system had been technologically implemented. When, after a 72-hour
shift ending early in the morning of July r6, r 8 8 8 , Edison had finally
completed a talking machine ready for serial production, he posed for the
hastily summoned photographer in the pose of his great idol. The French
emperor, after all, is said to have observed that the progress of national
welfare (or military technology) can be measured by transportation
costs.28 And no means of transportation are more economical than those
which convey information rather than goods and people. Artificial
mouths and ears, as technological implementations of the central nervous
system, cut down on mailmen and concert halls. What Ong calls our sec­
ondary orality has the elegance of brain functions. Technological sound
storage provides a first model for data streams, which are simultaneously
becoming objects of neurophysiological research. Helmholtz, as the per­
fecter of vowel theory, is allied with Edison, the perfecter of measuring in­
struments. Which is why sound storage, initially a mechanically primitive
affair on the level of Weber's pig bristle, could not be invented until the
soul fell prey to science. " 0 my head, my head, my head, " groans the
phonograph in the prose poem Alfred Jarry dedicated to it. "All white un­
derneath the silk sky: They have taken my head, my head-and put me
into a tea tin ! "29
Which is why Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, the symbolist poet and author
of the first of many Edison novels, is mistaken when, in Tomorrow's Eve,
he has the great inventor ponder his delay.
What is most surprising in history, almost unimaginable, is that among all the
great inventors across the centuries, not one thought of the Phonograph! And yet
most of them invented machines a thousand times more complicated. The
Phonograph is so simple that its construction owes nothing to materials of sci­
entific composition. Abraham might have built it, and made a recording of hisGramophone
29
calling from on high. A steel stylus, a leaf of silver foil or something like it, a
cylinder of copper, and one could fill a storehouse with all the voices of Heaven
and Earth.30
This certainly applies to materials and their processing, but it misses
the historical a priori of sound recording. There are also immaterials of
scientific origin, which are not so easy to come by and have to be supplied
by a science of the soul. They cannot be delivered by any of the post­
Abraham candidates whom Villiers de l'Isle-Adam suspects of being able
to invent the phonograph: neither Aristotle, Euclid, nor Archimedes could
have underwritten the statement that "The soul is a notebook of phono­
graphic recordings " (but rather, if at all, a tabula rasa for written signs,
which in turn signify acts of the soul). Only when the soul has become the
nervous system, and the nervous system (according to Sigmund Exner, the
great Viennese neurophysiologist) so many facilitations (Bahnungen), can
Delboeuf's statement cease to be scandalous. In 1 8 8 o, the philosopher
Guyau devoted a commentary to it. And this first theory of the phono­
graph attests like no other to the interactions between science and tech­
nology. Thanks to the invention of the phonograph, the very theories that
were its historical a priori can now optimize their analogous models of
the brain.30

Reasoning by analogy is of considerable importance to science; indeed, in as
far as it is the principle of induction it may well form the basis of all physi­
cal and psychophysical sciences. Discoveries frequently start with meta­
phors. The light of thinking could hardly fall in a new direction and illumi­
nate dark corners were it not reflected by spaces already illuminated. Only
that which reminds us of something else makes an impression, although and
precisely because it differs from it. To understand is to remember, at least in
part.
Many similes and metaphors have been used in the attempt to under­

Thus, the human brain has been compared to all
kinds of objects. According to Spencer it shows a certain analogy to the me­
chanical pianos that can reproduce an infinite number of melodies. Taine
makes of the brain a kind of print shop that incessantly produces and stores
innumerable cliches. Yet all these similes appear somewhat sketchy. One
normally deals with the brain at rest; its images are perceived to be fixed,
stereotyped;
and that is imprecise. There is nothing finished in the brain, no
real images; instead, we see only virtual, potential images waiting for a sign
to be transformed into actuality. How this transformation into reality is
really achieved is a matter of speculation. The greatest mystery of brain
mechanics has to do with dynamics-not with statics. We are in need of a
comparative term that will allow us to see not only how an object receives
and stores an imprint, but also how this imprint at a given time is reacti­
vated and produces new vibrations within the obj ect. With this in mind, the
most refined instrument (both receiver and motor in one) with which the
human brain may be compared is perhaps Edison's recently invented phono­
graph. For some time now
I have been wanting to draw attention to this
comparison, ever since I came across a casual observation in Delboeuf's last
article on memory that confirmed my intentions: "The soul is a notebook of
phonographic recordings. "
Upon speaking into a phonograph, the vibrations of one's voice are
transferred to a point that engraves lines onto a metal plate that correspond
to the uttered sounds-uneven furrows, more or less deep, depending on the
nature of the sounds. It is quite probable that in analogous ways, invisibleGramophone
3 I
lines are incessantly carved into the brain cells, which provide a channel for
nerve streams. If, after some time, the stream encounters a channel it has al­
ready passed through, it will once again proceed along the same path. The
cells vibrate in the same way they vibrated the first time; psychologically,
these similar vibrations correspond to an emotion or a thought analogous to
the forgotten emotion or thought.
This is precisely the phenomenon that occurs when the phonograph's
small copper disk, held against the point that runs through the grooves it
has etched, starts to reproduce the vibrations: to our ears, these vibrations
turn back into a voice, into words, sounds, and melodies.
If the phonographic disk had self-consciousness, it could point out
while replaying a song that it remembers this particular song. And what ap­
pears to us as the effect of a rather simple mechanism would, quite proba­
bly, strike the disk as a miraculous ability: memory.
Let us add that it could distinguish new songs from those already
played, as well as new impressions from simple memories. Indeed, a certain
effort is necessary for first impressions to etch themselves into metal or
brain; they encounter more resistance and, correspondingly, have to exert
more force; and when they reappear, they vibrate all the stronger. But when
the point traces already existing grooves instead of making new ones, it will
do so with greater ease and glide along without applying any pressure. The
inclination of a
memory or reverie has been spoken of; to pursue a memory,
in fact: to smoothly glide down a slope, to wait for a certain number of
complete memories, which appear one after the other, all in a row and with­
out shock. There is, therefore, a significant difference between impressions
in the real sense and memory. Impressions tend to belong to either of two
classes: they either possess greater intensity, a unique sharpness of outline
and fixity of line, or they are weaker, more blurred and imprecise, but nev­
ertheless arranged in a certain order that imposes itself on us. To recognize
an image means to assign it to the second class. One
feels in a less forceful
way and is aware of this emotion. A memory consists in the awareness,
first, of the diminished intensity of an impression, second, of its increased
ease, and third, of the connections it entertains with other impressions. Just
as a trained eye can see the difference between a copy and the original, we
learn to distinguish memories from impressions and are thus able to recog­
nize a memory even before it has been located in time and space. We project
this or that impression back into the past without knowing which part of
the past it belongs to. This is because a memory retains a unique and distin­
guishing character, much like a sensation coming from the stomach differs
from an acoustic or visual impression. In a similar manner, the phonograph32
Gramophone
is incapable of reproducing the human voice in all its strength and warmth.
The voice of the apparatus will remain shrill and cold; it has something im­
perfect and abstract about it that sets it apart. If the phonograph could hear
itself, it would learn to recognize the difference between the voice that came
from the outside and forced itself onto it and the voice that it itself is broad­
casting and which is a simple echo of the first, following an already grooved
path.
A further analogy between the phonograph and our brain exists in that
the speed of the vibrations impressed on the apparatus can noticeably
change the character of the reproduced sounds or recalled images. Depend­
ing on whether you increase or decrease the rotation of the phonographic
disk, a melody will be transposed from one octave to another. If you turn
the handle faster, a song will rise from the deepest and most indistinct notes
to the highest and most piercing. Does not a similar effect occur in the brain
when we focus our attention on an initially blurred image, increasing its
clarity step by step and thereby moving it, as it were, up the scale? And
could this phenomenon not be explained by the increased or decreased
speed and strength of the vibrations of our cells? We have within us a kind
of scale of images along which the images we conjure up and dismiss inces­
santly rise and fall. At times they vibrate in the depths of our being like a
blurred "pedal " ; at times their sonic fullness radiates above all others. As
they dominate or recede, they appear to be closer or farther away from us,
and sometimes the length of time separating them from the present moment
seems to be waning or waxing. I know of impressions I received ten years
ago that, under the influence of an association of ideas or simply owing to
my attention or some change of emotion, suddenly seem to date from yes­
terday. In the same way singers create the impression of distance by lower­
ing their voice; they merely need to raise it again to suggest the impression
of approaching.
These analogies could be multiplied. The principal difference between
the brain and the phonograph is that the metal disk of Edison's still rather
primitive machine remains deaf to itself; there is no transition from move­
ment to consciousness. It is precisely this wondrous transition that keeps oc­
curring in the brain. It remains an eternal mystery that is less astonishing
than it appears, however. Were the phonograph able to hear itself, it would
be far less mystifying in the final analysis than the idea of our hearing it.
But indeed we do: its vibrations really turn into impressions and thoughts.
We therefore have to concede the transformation of movement into thought
that is always possible-a transformation that appears more likely when it
is a matter of internal brain movement than when it comes from the out-Gramophone
33
side. From this point of view it would be neither very imprecise nor very
disconcerting to define the brain as an infinitely perfected phonograph-a
conscious phonograph.
It doesn't get any clearer than that. The psychophysical sciences, to which
the philosopher Guyau has absconded, embrace the phonograph as the
only suitable model for visualizing the brain or memory. All questions
concerning thought as thought have been abandoned, for it is now a mat­
ter of implementation and hardware. Thus memory, around 1 800 a
wholly "subordinate inner power, "31 moves to the fore eighty years later.
And because Hegel's spirit is thereby ousted from the start, the recently
invented phonograph, not yet even ready for serial production, is superior
to all other media. Unlike Gutenberg's printing press or Ehrlich's auto­
matic pianos in the brain metaphors of Taine and Spencer, it alone can
combine the two actions indispensable to any universal machine, discrete
or not: writing and reading, storing and scanning, recording and replay­
ing. In principle, even though Edison for practical reasons later separated
recording units from replaying ones, it is one and the same stylus that en­
graves and later traces the phonographic groove.
Which is why all concepts of trace, up to and including Derrida's
grammatological ur-writing, are based on Edison's simple idea. The trace
preceding all writing, the trace of pure difference still open between read­
ing and writing, is simply a gramophone needle. Paving a way and retrac­
ing a path coincide. Guyau understood that the phonograph implements
memory and thereby makes it unconscious.
It is only because no philosopher, not even one who has abandoned
philosophy for psychophysics, can rid himself of his professional delu­
sions that Guyau attempts to crown or surpass the unconscious mne­
monic capabilities of the phonograph at the end of his essay by contrast­
ing them with conscious human abilities. But consciousness, the quality
that Guyau ascribes to the brain in order to celebrate the latter as an infi­
nitely perfected phonograph, would result in an infinitely inferior one.
Rather than hearing the random acoustic events forcing their way into the
bell-mouth in all their real-time entropy, Guyau's conscious phonograph
would attempt to understand32 and thus corrupt them. Once again, al­
leged identities or meaning or even functions of consciousness would
come into play. Phonographs do not think, therefore they are possible.34
Gramophone
Trademark, " Writing Angel. "
Guyau's own, possibly unconscious example alludes to the imputa­
tion of consciousness and inner life: if a phonograph really possessed the
consciousness attributed to it and were able to point out that it remem­
bered a song, it would consider this a miraculous ability. But impartial
and external observers would continue to see it as the result of a fairly
simple mechanism. When Guyau, who had observed the brain simply as
a technical apparatus, turns his experimental gaze inward, he falls short
of his own standards. It was, after all, an external gaze that had suggested
the beautiful comparison between attention and playback speed. If the fo­
cusing of blurred mental images by way of attention amounts to nothing
more or less than changing the time axis of acoustic events by increasing
playback speed or indulging in time axis manipulation (TAM), then there
is no reason to celebrate attention or memory as miraculous abilities. Nei­
ther gramophone needles nor brain neurons need any self-consciousness
to retrace a groove faster than it was engraved. In both cases it boils
down to programming. For that reason alone the diligent hand of the
phonograph user, who in Edison's time had difficulties sticking to the cor­
rect time while turning the handle, could be replaced by clockworks and
electronic motors with adjustable speed. The sales catalogues of Ameri­
can record companies warned their customers of the friend who "comes
to you and claims that your machine is too slow or too fast. Don't listen
to him! He doesn't know what he is talking about. "33
But standardization is always upper management's escape from tech­
nological possibilities. In serious matters such as test procedures or massGramophone
35
entertainment, TAM remains triumphant. The Edison Speaking Phono­
graph Company, founded two months after Edison's primitive prototype
of December 1 8 77, did its first business with time axis manipulation:
with his own hand the inventor turned the handle faster than he had dur­
ing the recording in order to treat New York to the sensational pleasure
of frequency-modulated musical pieces. Even the modest cornet of a cer­
tain Levy acquired brilliance and temperament.34 Had he been among the
delighted New Yorkers, Guyau would have found empirical proof that
frequency modulation is indeed the technological correlative of attention.
Of course Europe's written music had already been able to move
tones upward or downward, as the term "scale" itself implies. But trans­
position doesn't equal TAM. If the phonographic playback speed differs
from its recording speed, there is a shift not only in clear sounds but in
entire noise spectra. What is manipulated is the real rather than the sym­
bolic. Long-term acoustic events such as meter and word length are af­
fected as well. This is precisely what von Hornbostel, albeit without rec­
ognizing what distinguished it from transposition, praised as the "special
advantage" of the phonograph: "It can be played at faster and slower
speeds, allowing us to listen to musical pieces whose original speed was
too fast at a more settled pace, and accordingly transposed, in order to
analyze them."35
The phonograph is thus incapable of achieving real-time frequency
shifts. For this we need rock bands with harmonizers that are able to re­
verse -with considerable electronic effort-the inevitable speed changes,
at least to deceivable human ears. Only then are people able to return si­
multaneously and in real time from their breaking voices, and women can
be men and men can be women again.
Time axis reversal, which the phonograph makes possible, allows
ears to hear the unheard-of: the steep attack of instrumental sounds or
spoken syllables moves to the end, while the much longer decay moves to
the front. The Beatles are said to have used this trick on "Revolution 9 "
to whisper the secret of their global success to the tape freaks among their
fans:36 that Paul McCartney had been dead for a long time, replaced on
album covers, stage, and in songs by a multimedia double. As the Co­
lumbia Phonograph Company recognized in 1 890, the phonograph can be
used as machine for composing music simply by allowing consumers to
play their favorite songs backwards: "A musician could get one popular
melody every day by experimenting in that way."37
TAM as poetry-but poetry that transgresses its customary bound­
aries. The phonograph cannot deny its telegraphic origin. Technological36
Gramophone
media turn magic into a daily routine. Voices that start to migrate through
frequency spectra and time axes do not simply continue old literary word­
game techniques such as palindromes or anagrams. This letter-bending
had become possible only once the primary code, the alphabet itself, had
taken effect. Time axis manipulation, however, affects the raw material of
poetry, where manipulation had hitherto been impossible. Hegel had re­
ferred to "the sound" as "a disappearing of being in the act of being,"
subsequently celebrating it as a " saturated expression of the manifesta­
tion of inwardness. "3 8 What was impossible to store could not be manip­
ulated. Ridding itself of its materiality or clothes, it disappeared and pre­
sented inwardness as a seal of authenticity.
But once storage and manipulation coincide in principle, Guyau's the­
sis linking phonography and memory may be insufficient. Storage facili­
ties, which according to his own insight are capable of altering the char­
acter of the replayed sounds (thanks to time manipulation), shatter the
very concept of memory. Reproduction is demoted once the past in all its
sensuous detail is transmitted by technical devices. Certainly, hi-fi means
"high fidelity" and is supposed to convince consumers that record com­
panies remain loyal to musical deities. But it is a term of appeasement.
More precise than the poetic imagination of 1 8 00, whose alphabetism or
creativity confronted an exclusively reproductive memory, technology lit­
erally makes the unheard-of possible. An old Pink Floyd song spells it out:
When that old fat sun in the sky's falling
Summer ev'ning birds are calling
Summer Sunday and a year
The sound of music in my ear
Distant bells
New mown grass smells
Songs sweet
By the river holding hands.
And if you see, don't make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the wall night falls
The silver sound of a tongue so strange,
Sing to me sing to me. 39
The literally unheard-of is the site where information technology and
brain physiology coincide. To make no sound, to pick your feet up off the
ground, and to listen to the sound of a voice when night is falling-we all
do it when we put on a record that commands such magic.
And what transpires then is indeed a strange and unheard-of silverGramophone
37
noise. Nobody knows who is singing-the voice called David Gilmour
that sings the song, the voice referred to by the song, or maybe the voice
of the listener who makes no sound and is nonetheless supposed to sing
once all the conditions of magic have been met. An unimaginable close­
ness of sound technology and self-awareness, a simulacrum of a feedback
loop relaying sender and receiver. A song sings to a listening ear, telling it
to sing. As if the music were originating in the brain itself, rather than em­
anating from stereo speakers or headphones.
That is the whole difference between arts and media. Songs, arias,
and operas do not rely on neurophysiology. Voices hardly implode in our
ears, not even under the technical conditions of a concert hall, when
singers are visible and therefore discernible. For that reason their voices
have been trained to overcome distances and spaces. The "sound of mu­
sic in my ear" can exist only once mouthpieces and microphones are ca­
pable of recording any whisper. As if there were no distance between the
recorded voice and listening ears, as if voices traveled along the transmit­
ting bones of acoustic self-perception directly from the mouth into the
ear's labyrinth, hallucinations become real.
And even the distant bells that the song listens to are not merely sig­
nifiers or referents of speech. As a form of literature, lyric had been able
to provide as much and no more. Countless verses used words to conjure
up acoustic events as lyrical as they were indescribable. As rock songs,
lyric poetry can add the bells themselves in order to fill attentive brains
with something that, as long as it had been confined to words, had re­
mained a mere promise.
In 1 89 8 , the Columbia Phonograph Company Orchestra offered the
song "Down on the Swanee River" as one of its 80 cylinders. Advertise­
ments promised Negro songs and dances, as well as the song's location
and subject: pulling in the gangplank, the sounds of the steam engine,
and, 80 years before Pink Floyd, the chiming of a steamboat be1l4°-all
for 50 cents. Songs became part of their acoustic environment. And lyrics
fulfilled what psychoanalysis-originating not coincidentally at the same
time-saw as the essence of desire: hallucinatory wish fulfillment.
Freud's "Project for a Scientific Psychology" ( 1 89 5 ) saw the state of "be­
ing hallucinated in a backward flow of Q to <\l and also to (0. "41 In other
words: impermeable brain neurons occupied by memory traces rid them­
selves of their charge or quantity by transferring them onto permeable
neurons designed for sensory perception. As a result, data already stored
appear as fresh input, and the psychic apparatus becomes its own simu-38
Gramophone
lacrum. Backflow or feedback comes as close to perfect hallucinatory
wish fulfillment as Freud's "Project for a Scientific Psychology" does to
technological media. "The intention is to furnish a psychology that shall
be a natural science: that is, to represent psychical processes as quantita­
tively determinate states of specifiable material particles, thus making
those processes perspicuous and free from contradiction. "42 That is psy­
chophysics at its best. All of Freud's elaborations on neurons and their
cathexes and on facilitations and their resistance are based on the "views
on localization held by [the] cerebral anatomy"43 of his time. That the
psychic apparatus (already technified by its name) can transmit and store
data while remaining both permeable and impermeable would remain an
insoluble paradox were its analogy modeled upon writing. (At best,
Freud's famous "Mystic Writing-Pad, " commented upon by Derrida,44
might be able to carry out both functions.) A brain physiology that fol­
lowed Broca and Wernicke's subdivision of discourse into numerous sub­
routines and located speaking, hearing, writing, and reading in various
parts of the brain (because it exclusively focused on the states of specifi­
able material particles) had to model itself on the phonograph-an insight
anticipated by Guyau. It comes as no surprise, then, that Sigmund Exner,
whose research formed the basis for Freud's notion of facilitation in "Sci­
entific Project, " also "provided the basis for the construction of a scien­
tific phonographic museum" at the University of Vienna.45
" When it comes to molecules and cranial pathways, we"-that is, the
brain researchers and art physiologists of the turn of the century-" auto­
matically think of a process similar to that of Edison's phonograph. "46
These are the words of Georg Hirth, author of the first German treatise
on art physiology. Twenty years later, they were written into art itself. In
I9I9, Rilke completed a prose "essay" that, using the modest means of
bricolage or literature, translated all the discoveries of brain physiology
into modern poetry.
RAINER MARIA RI LKE, " PRIMAL S O UND " ( 19 19 )
It must have been when I was a boy at school that the phonograph was in­
vented. At any rate it was at that time a chief object of public wonder; this
was probably the reason why our science master, a man given to busying
himself with all kinds of handiwork, encouraged us to try our skill in mak-Gramophone
39
ing one o f these instruments from the material that lay nearest to hand.
Nothing more was needed than a piece of pliable cardboard bent to the
shape of a funnel, on the narrower orifice of which was stuck a piece of
impermeable paper of the kind used to bottle fruit. This provided a vibrat­
ing membrane, in the middle of which we stuck a bristle from a coarse
clothes brush at right angles to its surface. With these few things one part
of the mysterious machine was made, receiver and reproducer were com­
plete. It now only remained to construct the receiving cylinder, which could
be moved close to the needle marking the sounds by means of a small rotat­
ing handle. I do not remember what we made it of; there was some kind
of cylinder which we covered with a thin coating of candle wax to the
best of our ability. Our impatience, brought to a pitch by the excitement
of sticking and fitting the parts as we j ostled one another over it, was such
that the wax had scarcely cooled and hardened before we put our work to
the test.
How now this was done can easily be imagined. When someone spoke
or sang into the funnel, the needle in the parchment transferred the sound
waves to the receptive surface of the roll slowly turning beneath it, and
then, when the moving needle was made to retrace its path (which had been
fixed in the meantime with a coat of varnish), the sound which had been
ours came back to us tremblingly, haltingly from the paper funnel, uncer­
tain, infinitely soft and hesitating and fading out altogether in places. Each
time the effect was complete. Our class was not exactly one of the quietest,
and there can have been few moments in its history when it had been able
as a body to achieve such a degree of silence. The phenomenon, on every
reception of it, remained astonishing, indeed positively staggering. We were
confronting, as it were, a new and infinitely delicate point in the texture of
reality, from which something far greater than ourselves, yet indescribably
immature, seemed to be appealing to us as if seeking help. At the time and
all through the intervening years I believed that that independent sound,
taken from us and preserved outside of us, would be unforgettable. That
it turned out otherwise is the cause of my writing the present account. As
will be seen, what impressed itself on my memory most deeply was not the
sound from the funnel but the markings traced on the cylinder; these made
a most definite impression.
I first became aware of this some fourteen or fifteen years after my
school days were past. It was during my first stay in Paris. At that time I
was attending the anatomy lectures in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts with consid­
erable enthusiasm. It was not so much the manifold interlacing of the mus-40
Gramophone
cles and sinews nor the complete inner agreement of the inner organs with
another that appealed to me, but rather the bare skeleton, the restrained en­
ergy and elasticity of which I had already noticed when studying the draw­
ings of Leonardo. However much I puzzled over the structure of the whole,
it was more than I could deal with; my attention always reverted to the
study of the skull, which seemed to me to constitute the utmost achieve­
ment, as it were, of which this chalky element was capable; it was as if it
had been persuaded to make just in this part a special effort to render a de­
cisive service by providing a most solid protection for the most daring fea­
ture of all, for something which, though itself narrowly confined, had a field
of activity which was boundless. The fascination which this particular struc­
ture had for me reached such a pitch finally, that I procured a skull in order
to spend many hours of the night with it; and, as always happens with me
and things, it was not only the moments of deliberate attention which made
this ambiguous object really mine: l owe my familiarity with it, beyond
doubt, in part to that passing glance with which we involuntarily examine
and perceive our daily environment, when there exists any relationship at all
between it and us. It was a passing glance of this kind which I suddenly
checked in its course, making it exact and attentive. By candlelight-which
is often so peculiarly alive and challenging-the coronal suture had become
strikingly visible, and I knew at once what it reminded me of: one of those
unforgotten grooves, which had been scratched in a little wax cylinder by
the point of a bristle !
And now I do not know: is it due to a rhythmic peculiarity of my imag­
ination that ever since, often after the lapse of years, I repeatedly feel the
impulse to make that spontaneously perceived similarity the starting point
for a whole series of unheard-of experiments ? I frankly confess that I have
always treated this desire, whenever it made itself felt, with the most unre­
lenting mistrust-if proof be needed, let it be found in the fact that only
now, after more than a decade and a half, have I resolved to make a cau­
tious statement concerning it. Furthermore, there is nothing I can cite in
favor of my idea beyond its obstinate recurrence, a recurrence which has
taken me by surprise in all sorts of places, divorced from any connection
with what I might be doing.
What is
it that repeatedly presents itself to my mind ? It is this:
The coronal suture of the skull (this would first have to be investigated)
has-let us assume -a certain similarity to the close wavy line which the
needle of a phonograph engraves on the receiving, rotating cylinder of the
apparatus. What if one changed the needle and directed it on its return j our­
ney along a tracing which was not derived from the graphic translation ofGramophone
4I
sound but existed of itself naturally-well, to put it plainly, along the coro­
nal suture, for example. What would happen? A sound would necessarily
result, a series of sounds, music . . . .
Feelings-which? Incredulity, timidity, fear, awe -which of all feelings
here possible prevents me from suggesting a name for the primal sound
which would then make its appearance in the world? . . .
Leaving that aside for the moment: what variety of lines, then, occur­
ring anywhere, could one not put under the needle and try out? Is there any
contour that one could not, in a sense, complete in this way and then expe­
rience it, as it makes itself felt, thus transformed, in another field of sense?
At one period, when I began to interest myself in Arabic poems, which
seem to owe their existence to the simultaneous and equal contributions
from all five senses, it struck me for the first time that the modern European
poet makes use of these five contributors singly and in very varying degree,
only one of them-sight overladen with the world-seeming to dominate
him constantly; how slight, by contrast, is the contribution he receives from
inattentive hearing, not to speak of the indifference of other senses, which
are active only on the periphery of consciousness and with many interrup­
tions within the limited sphere of their practical activity. And yet the perfect
poem can only materialize on condition that this world, acted upon by all
five levers simultaneously, is seen, under a definite aspect, on the supernat­
ural plane, which is, in fact, the plane of the poem.
A lady, to whom this was mentioned in conversation, exclaimed that
this wonderful and simultaneous capacity and achievement of all the senses
was surely nothing but the presence of mind and grace of love -incidentally
she thereby bore her own witness to the sublime reality of the poem. But
the lover is in such splendid danger just because he must depend on the co­
ordination of his senses, for he knows that they must meet in that unique
and risky center in which, renouncing all extension, they come together and
have no permanence.
As I write this, I have before me the diagram which I have always used
as a ready help whenever ideas of this kind have demanded attention. If the
world's whole field of experience, including those spheres which are beyond
our knowledge, be represented in a complete circle, it will be immediately
evident that when the black sectors, denoting that which we are incapable
of experiencing, are measured against the lesser, light sections, correspond
to that which is illuminated by the senses, the former are very much greater.
Now the position of the lover is this: that he feels himself unexpectedly
placed in the center of the circle, that is to say, at the point where the42
Gramophone
known and the incomprehensible, coming forcibly together at one single
point, become complete and simply a possession, losing thereby, it is true,
all individual character. This position would not serve for the poet, for indi­
vidual variety must be constantly present for him; he is compelled to use the
sense sectors to their full extent, as it must also be in his aim to extend each
of them as far as possible, so that his lively delight, girded for the attempt,
may be able to pass through the five gardens in one leap.
As the lover's danger consists in the nonspatial character of his stand­
point, so the poet's lies in his awareness of the abysses which divide the one
order of sense experience from the other: in truth they are sufficiently wide
and engulfing to sweep away from before us the greater part of the world­
who knows how many worlds ?
The question arises here as to whether the extent of these sectors on the
plane assumed by us can be enlarged to any vital degree by the work of re­
search. The achievements of the microscope, of the telescope, and of so
many devices which increase the range of the senses upward and down­
ward: do they not lie in
another sphere altogether, since most of the increase
thus achieved cannot be interpreted by the senses, cannot be "experienced"
in any real sense? It is perhaps not premature to suppose that the artist, who
develops the five-fingered hand of his senses (if one may put it so) to ever
more active and more spiritual capacity, contributes more decisively than
anyone else to an extension of the several sense fields; only the achievement
which gives proof of this does not permit of his entering his personal exten­
sion of territory in the general map before us, since it is only possible, in the
last resort, by a miracle.
But if we are looking for a way by which to establish the connection so
urgently needed between the different provinces now so strangely separated
from one another, what could be more promising than the experiment sug­
gested earlier in this recollection? If the writer ends by recommending it
once again, he may be given a certain amount of credit for withstanding the
temptation to give free reign to his fancy in imagining the results of the as­
sumptions which he has suggested.
Soglio. On the day of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin,
I9I9.
Rilke dedicated the most impassionate of reports to phonography. Re­
gardless of the fact that he wrote it on the Assumption, "he was a poet
and hated the approximate. "47 Therefore the strange precision withGramophone
43
which his text enumerates all the parts of an apparatus that Rilke's
physics teacher, employed not coincidentally at an imperial military
school, constructed around 1 890. As if to confirm the fictional Edison of
Tomorrow's Eve, who had no supply problems whatsoever when design­
ing the phonograph, a combination of cardboard, paper, the bristles of a
clothes brush, and candle wax suffice to open a "new and infinitely deli­
cate point in the texture of reality. " Oblivious to the knowledge of the
physics teacher and the school drill, students hear their own voices. Not
their words and answers as programmed feedback by the education sys­
tem, but the real voice against a backdrop of pure silence or attention.
And yet the " unforgettable" (in the word's double meaning) phono­
graphic sound recording is not at the center of Rilke's profane illumina­
tion. In the founding age of media, the author is captivated more by the
technological revolutions of reading than of writing. The " markings
traced on the cylinder" are physiological traces whose strangeness tran­
scends all human voices.
Certainly, the writer is no brain physiologist. His amateur status at
the Ecole des Beaux-Arts enables him to become acquainted with the vi­
cissitudes of the skeletal structure, but not with the facilitations on which
Exner or Freud based their new sciences. But when it comes to mounted
and exhibited skeletons, Rilke is fascinated by that "utmost achievement"
known as the skull, because "it was as if it had been persuaded to make
just in this part a special effort to render a decisive service by providing a
most solid protection for the most daring feature of all . " During his
Parisian nights, Rilke reduces the skull sitting in front of him to a cerebral
container. Describing it as "this particular structure" with a "boundless
field of activity, " he merely repeats the physiological insight that for our
central nervous system, "our own body is the outside world. "48 One no
less than Flechsig, Schreber's famous psychiatrist, had proven that the
cerebral cortex contains a " sphere of physical perception" that neurolog­
ically reproduces all parts of the body, distorted according to their im­
portance.49 Rilke's belief in later years that it was the task of poetry to
transfer all given data into an " inner world space" is based on such in­
sights. (Even though literary scholars, still believing in the omnipotence of
philosophers, choose to relate Rilke's inner world space to Husserl. )50
"Primal Sound" leaves no doubt whatsoever about which contempo­
rary developments were most important to literature in 1900. Instead of
lapsing into the usual melancholic associations of Shakespeare's Hamlet
or Keller's Green Henry at the sight of a human skull in candlelight, the
writer sees phonographic grooves.44
Gramophone
Coronal suture from stp to stp.
A trace or path or groove appears where the frontal and parietal
bones of the "suckling infant"51-to use Rilke's anatomically correct
term-have grown together. As if the facilitations of Freud and Exner had
been projected out of the brain onto its enclosure, the naked eye is now
able to read the coronal suture as a writing of the real. A technologically
up-to-date author follows in the wake of the brain physiologists, who
since the days of Guyau and Hirth have automatically thought of Edison's
phonograph when dealing with nerve pathways. Moreover, Rilke draws
conclusions more radical than all scientific boldness. Before him, nobody
had ever suggested to decode a trace that nobody had encoded and that
encoded nothing.
Ever since the invention of the phonograph, there has been writing
without a subject. It is no longer necessary to assign an author to every
trace, not even God. "Project for a Scientific Psychology" centered on fa­
cilitations inscribed by acts of perception, but there is no reason not to set
the gramophone needle to random anatomic features. A transgression in
the literal sense of the word, which shakes the very words used to phrase
it. Acoustics arises from physiology, technology from nature. In Rilke's
time, skulls were measured in search of all possible features: intelligence
and idiocy, masculinity and femininity, genius and racial characteristics.
But their transposition into the acoustic medium remained a challenge
that forced dots and question marks onto the writing hand.
What the coronal suture yields upon replay is a primal sound with­
out a name, a music without notation, a sound even more strange thanGramophone
45
any incantation for the dead for which the skull could have been used.
Deprived of its shellac, the duped needle produces sounds that "are not
the result of a graphic transposition of a note" but are an absolute trans­
fer, that is, a metaphor. A writer thus celebrates the very opposite of his
own medium-the white noise no writing can store. Technological media
operate against a background of noise because their data travel along
physical channels; as in blurring in the case of film or the sound of the
needle in the case of the gramophone, that noise determines their signal­
to-noise ratio. According to Arnheim, that is the price they pay for deliv­
ering reproductions that are at the same time effects of the reproduced.
Noise is emitted by the channels media have to cross.
In 1924, five years after Rilke's "Primal Sound, " Rudolph Lothar
wrote The Talking Machine: A Technical-Aesthetic Essay. Based on the
not-very-informed premise that "philosophers and psychologists have
hitherto written about the arts" and "neglected" phonography,52 Lothar
drew up a new aesthetic. Its key propositions center exclusively on the re­
lationship between noise and signals.
The talking machine occupies a special position in aesthetics and music. It de­
mands a twofold capacity for illusion, an illusion working in two directions. On
the one hand, it demands that we ignore and overlook its mechanical features. As
we know, every record comes with interference. As connoisseurs we are not al­
lowed to hear this interference, just as in a theater we are obliged to ignore both
the line that sets off the stage and the frame surrounding the scene. We have to
forget we are witnessing actors in costumes and makeup who are not really expe­
riencing what they are performing. They are merely playing parts. We, however,
pretend to take their appearance for reality. Only if we forget that we are inside a
theater can we really enjoy dramatic art. This " as if" is generated by our capacity
for illusion. Only when we forget that the voice of the singer is coming from a
wooden box, when we no longer hear any interference, when we can suspend it
the way we are able to suspend a stage-only then will the talking machine come
into its own artistically.
But, on the other hand, the machine demands that we give bodies to the
sounds emanating from it. For example, while playing an aria sung by a famous
singer we see the stage he stands on, we see him dressed in an appropriate cos­
tl,lme. The more it is linked to our memories, the stronger the record's effect will
be. Nothing excites memory more strongly than the human voice, maybe because
nothing is forgotten as quickly as a voice. Our memory of it, however, does not
die-its timbre and character sink into our subconscious where they await their
revival. What has been said about the voice naturally also applies to instruments.
We see Nikisch conduct the C-minor symphony, we see Kreisler with the violin at
his chin, we see trumpets flashing in the sun when listening to military marches.46

But the capacity for illusion that enables us to ignore boxes and interference and
furnishes tones with a visible background requires musical sensitivity. This is the
most important point of phonographic aesthetics: The talking machine can only
grant artistic satisfaction to musical people. For only musicians possess the ca­
pacity for illusion necessary for every enjoyment of art. 53
Maybe Rilke, who loved the gong, with its resounding mixture of
frequencies, above all other instruments, wasn't a musical person.54 His
aesthetic-"Primal Sound" is Rilke's only text about art and the beautiful
in general-subverts the two illusions to which Lothar wants to commit
readers or gramophone listeners. From the fact that "every record comes
with interferences" he draws opposite conclusions. Replaying the skull's
coronary suture yields nothing but noise. And there is no need to add
some hallucinated body when listening to signs that are not the result of
the graphic translation of a note but rather random anatomical lines. Bod­
ies themselves generate noise. And the impossible real transpires.
Of course, the entertainment industry is all on Lothar's side. But
there have been and there still are experiments that pursue Rilke's primal
sound with technologically more sophisticated means. In the wake of
Mondrian and the Bruitists (who wanted to introduce noise into literature
and music), Moholy-Nagy already suggested in 1923 turning "the gramo­
phone from an instrument of reproduction into a productive one, gener­
ating acoustic phenomena without any previous acoustic existence by
scratching the necessary marks onto the record. "55 An obvious analogy to
Rilke's suggestion of eliciting sounds from the skull that were not the re­
sult of a prior graphic transformation. A triumph for the concept of fre­
quency: in contrast to the "narrowness " of a "scale" that is "possibly a
thousand years old" and to which we therefore no longer must adhere,56
Moholy-Nagy's etchings allow for unlimited transposition from medium
to medium. Any graphisms-including those, not coincidentally, domi­
nating Mondrian's paintings-result in a sound. Which is why the exper­
imenter asks for the "study of graphic signs of the most diverse (simulta­
neous and isolated) acoustic phenomena" and the "use of projection ma­
chines" or "film."57
Engineers and the avant-garde think alike. At the same time as
Moholy-Nagy's etching, the first plans were made for sound film, one of
the first industrially connected media systems. "The invention of Mr.
Vogt, Dr. Engel, and Mr. Masolle, the speaking Tri-Ergon-film, " was
based on a "highly complicated process" of medial transformations that
could only be financed with the help of million-dollar investments fromGramophone

the C. Lorenz Company. 58 The inventors say of it, "Acoustic waves ema­
nating from the scene are converted into electricity, electricity is turned
into light, light into the silver coloring of the positive and negative, the
coloring of the film back into light, which is then converted back into
electricity before the seventh and final transformation turns electricity
into the mechanical operation of a weak membrane giving off sounds. "59
Frequencies remain frequencies regardless of their respective carrier
medium. The symbolic correlation of sound intervals and planetary or­
bits, which since [Cicero'S] Dream of Scipio made up the harmony of the
spheres, is replaced by correspondences in the real. In order to synchro­
nize, store, and reproduce acoustic events and image sequences, sound
films can let them wander seven times from one carrier to the next. In
Moholy-Nagy's own words, his record etchings are capable of generating
a "new mechanical harmony" : "The individual graphic signs are exam­
ined and their proportions are formulated as a law. (Here we may point48

Block schematic of an analog vocoder. The synthesis component
is in the lower signal path, the analysis component, in the upper
signal path. The latter's low- and high-pass filters limit the input,
for example, of "speech," while its band-pass filters break down the
audible range into several component frequency channels.Following
its coordination as envelope curves, the analysis output-using a
switching matrix with arbitrarily chosen correspondences between
the signal paths-controls the voltage-controlled amplifiers (yeAs),
whose band-pass filters have also broken down the "input" or
carrier into several component frequency channels. The sum signal
at the exit (of the vocoder) appears as an instrumental sound
encoded by a voice (vox).
out a consideration that is at present still utopian: based on strict propor­
tional laws graphic signs can be transposed into music. ) " 60
This idea had lost its utopian character long before it was written
down. Fourier's solution of all continuous functions (including musical
notes) into sums of pure sine harmonics was achieved before Helmholtz
and Edison. Walsh's equally mathematical proof that square wave vibra­
tions may also serve as summands of the Fourier analysis was roughly
contemporaneous with Moholy-Nagy's writings. As a result, in 19 64
Robert A. Moog, with his electronic talents and the "American vice of
modular repetition,"61 was able to equip all the sound studios and rock
bands of this world with synthesizers. A subtractive sound analysis, that
is, one controlled by frequency filters, transfers the proportional relation­
ships of graphic depictions (rectangles, saw tooth curves, triangles, trape­
zoids, and maybe even sine curves) into the music envisioned by Mon­
drian and Moholy-Nagy.62

perience it, as it makes itself felt, thus transformed, in another field of
sense" : it is realized every night in the combination of amplifier and os­
cillographic display.
But there is more to it. Between 1942 and 194 5 , while working for
Bell laboratories and the British Secret Service, respectively, Shannon and
Turing developed the vocoder, a wonder weapon that would make the
transatlantic telephone conversations between Churchill and Roosevelt
safe from interception by Canaris and the German Abwehr63 and that,
like so many electronic achievements of the Second World War, is now in­
dispensable to popular music. It lives up to its name: it encodes any given
data stream A with the envelope curves of another sound sequence B, for
example, the voice of a singer, after a switching matrix has changed the
frequency of the envelope curves by way of free permutation. In the case
of Laurie Anderson's electronic violin, the one-third octave band between
440 and 5 5 0 Hz follows in absolute synchronicity the volume her voice
happens to have in the one-third octave band between 1 760 and 2200
Hz, while a third one-third octave band of her songs controls a fourth
band of her violin, and so on and so forth. Primal sounds do not cor­
respond to anatomical features and sounds do not follow Mondrian's
graphics; rather, the paradoxical result is that one and the same controls
one and the same: one acoustics controls the other.
To test his vocoder, by the way, Turing first played a record of Win­
ston Churchill's belligerent voice, whose discreet or cut-up sampled val­
ues he then mixed with a noise generator using modular addition. Where­
upon British officers heard the voice of their prime minister and com­
mander in chief contaminate the speakers as just so much white noise
(not to say, primal sound). Appropriately, Turing's vocoder was named af­
ter Delilah, who in the Book of Judges tricked another warrior, the
Danaite Samson, out of the secret of his strength. Turing's skill as a tin­
kerer, however, revealed the secret of modern political discourse to be
something far worse than weakness: it is "a perfectly even and uninfor­
mative hiss,"64 which offered no regularities and, therefore, nothing in­
telligible to the ears of British officers or those of German eavesdroppers.
And yet, sent through the vocoder a second time, Churchill's original
voice emerged from the receiving end.
This is what has become of the "abysses" that, according to Rilke's
ingenious formula, "divide the one order of sense experience from the
other. " In today's media networks, algorithmically formalized data
streams can traverse them all. Media facilitate all possible manipulations:
acoustic signals control the optical signals of light consoles, electronic lan-50
Gramophone
guage controls the acoustic output of computer music, and, in the case of
the vocoder, one set of acoustic signals controls another. Finally, New
York disc jockeys turn the esoteric graphisms of Moholy-Nagy into the
everyday experience of scratch music.
But Rilke's astute diagnosis only applies to the founding age when the
three ur-media-phonograph, film, and typewriter-first differentiated
acoustics, optics, and writing. Nevertheless, as if anticipating today's me­
dia systems, he searched "for a way to establish the connection so ur­
gently needed between the different provinces now so strangely separated
from one another. " Which is why he fell back on "Arabic poems, which
seem to owe their existence to the simultaneous and equal contributions
from all five senses, " and which let eyes trained in the art of calligraphy
enjoy the very materiality of letters. This explains his criticism, histori­
cally extremely accurate, of literary epochs such as the Age of Goethe, in
which "sight" alone seems to dominate authors and readers because cor­
rect reading involves a hallucinatory process that turns words into a real
and visible world. This explains as well his proposition for an equally
lyrical and scientific coronal suture phonography, which would pay more
attention to acoustics than did the "inattentive hearing" of authors from
the Age of Goethe.
But before Rilke wrote down his proposal on the Assumption in the
alpine solitude of the Bergell, he related it to a woman. Synchronicity of
the asynchronic: on the one hand a writer whose " extension" or combi­
nation of sensory media goes beyond "the work of research" ; on the other
a woman who mistakes coronal suture phonography for "love," and
love -as involuntary evidence for "the sublime reality of the poem"-for
poems. Only as long as the unchallenged and unrivaled medium of the
book was able to simulate the storage of all possible data streams did love
remain literature and literature love; the ascension of female readers.
But a writer whose school teaches physics instead of philosophy ob­
jects. The combination of sensory data streams achieved by love is devoid
of "permanence. " It cannot be stored by any medium. Moreover, it loses
"all individual character. " That is, no real can pass through the filter of
love. Which is why love does " not serve for the poet, for individual vari­
ety must be constantly present for him; he is compelled to use the sense
sectors to their full extent, " or, simply, to become a media technician
among media technicians.
Marinetti's Technical Manifesto of Futurist Literature of 19 1 2 pro­
claimed that crowds of massed molecules and whirling electrons areGramophone
5 I
more exciting than the smiles or tears of a woman (di una donna) .65 In
other words: literature defects from erotics to stochastics, from red lips
to white noise. Marinetti's molecular swarms and whirling electrons are
merely instances of the Brownian motion that human eyes can only per­
ceive in the shape of dancing sun particles but that in the real are the
noise on all channels. According to Rilke, the "abysses" dividing the or­
ders of sense experience are "sufficiently wide and engulfing to sweep
away from before us the greater part of the world-who knows how
many worlds ? " Which is why love is no longer sufficient for authors
who, like Rilke himself, transcribe all the details of sensory perception
into an inner world-space known as the brain or literature and, subse­
quently, phonographically trace the facilitations of this unique container
as primal sound itself.
Phonography, notation, and a new eroticism-this is precisely the
constellation described by Maurice Renard in a short story of 1907, ten
years prior to Rilke's essay. What Rilke saw in the coronal suture Re­
nard's fictitious composer Nerval encounters in a roaring seashell, which,
like Rilke's skull, is a physiological substitute for Edison's apparatus.
Thirty years later Paul Valery used almost the same title as that of Re­
nard's story to celebrate shells as architectural works of an artistic na­
ture,66 but Renard focuses on the central nervous system, on the labyrinth
of shells, auricles, and sound. Since machines have taken over the func­
tions of the central nervous system, nobody can say whether the roaring
comes from the blood or from the sirens, from the ears or from the sea
goddess Amphitrite.

Put the shell back where it belongs, Doctor, and do not hold it to your ear
for the pleasure of mistaking the roaring of your blood with that of the sea.
Put it back. The very man we just buried, our beloved great musician,
would still be alive had he not committed the childish mistake of listening
to what the mouth of a shell has to say . . . Yes indeed: Nerval, your very
own patient . . . You talk of congestion? Maybe. But I am skeptical. Here
are my reasons. Keep them to yourself.52
Gramophone
Last Wednesday night, on the day before the accident, I dined at Ner­
val's. His close friends have been meeting there every Wednesday for twenty
years. There were five in the beginning. But this time, and for the first time,
there were only two of us: a stroke, a contagious flu, and a suicide left Ner­
val and me facing each other. When you reach sixty such a situation has
nothing amusing about it. You keep asking yourself who will be next.
The meal was as gloomy as a funeral feast. The great man remained
silent. I did everything possible to cheer him up. Maybe he was mourning
other deaths, the secrecy of which made them even more bitter . . . .
Indeed, he was mourning others.
We went to his study. The piano had not been closed; on it there was
the first page of a new composition.
" What are you working on, Nerval ? "
H e raised his finger and spoke like a sad prophet announcing his god:
"Amphitrite. "
"Amphitrite! At last!
For how many years have you been saving her up? "
"Since the Rome prize. I waited and waited. The longer a work i s al-
lowed to mature, the better it is, and I wanted to infuse it with the dream
and experience of a whole life . . . I believe it is time . . . "
"A symphonic poem, isn't it? . . . Are you satisfied ? "
Nerval shook his head.
"No. In a pinch, it might work . . . My thoughts are not distorted be­
yond recognition . . . "
He interpreted the prelude with great virtuosity: a " Train of Neptune. "
You will relish it, Doctor; it is a miracle!
" You see," Nerval said to me while striking strange, outrageous, and
brutal chords, "up to this fanfare of Tritons it works . . . "
"Marvelous, " I answered; "there is . . . "
"But," Nerval continued, " that is all there is to it. The choir that fol­
lows . . . a failure. Yes, I can feel my powerlessness to write it . . . It is too
beautiful. We no longer know . . . It would have to be composed the way
Phidias created his sculptures; it would have to be a Parthenon, as simple
as . . . We no longer know . . . Ha ! " he suddenly screamed, "to have arrived
there, I . . . "
"Listen," I said to him, "you are among the most famous, so . . . "
" So, if this is how I end up, what do others know? But at least their
mediocrity is a blessing, which is itself mediocre and satisfied with little.
Famous! What is fame when engulfed in sadness! . . . "
"The peaks are always clouded! . . . "Gramophone
53
"Enough," Nerval resumed, " a cease-fire for flattery! This is truly a sad
hour, so let us, if you wish, dedicate it to real sorrows. We owe it to the
departed."
Following these rather mysterious words he took a phonograph from
underneath a blanket. I understood.
You can well imagine, Doctor, that this phonograph did not play the
"Potpourri from
The Doll,
performed by the Republican Guard under
Pares. " The very improved, sonorous, and clear machine only had a few
cylinders. It merely spoke . . .
Yes, you guessed it: on Wednesday the dead spoke to us . . .
How terrible it is to hear this copper throat and its sounds from beyond
the grave ! It is more than a photographic, or I had better say cinemato­
graphic, something; it is the voice itself, the living voice, still alive among
carrion, skeletons, nothingness . . .
The composer was slumped in his chair next to the fireside. He listened
with painfully knit brows to the tender things our departed comrades said
from the depths of the altar and the grave.
" Well, science does have its advantages, Nerval! As a source of miracles
and passions it is approaching art . "
" Certainly. The more powerful the telescopes, the larger the number of
stars is going to be. Of course science has its good sides. But for us it is still
too young. Only our heirs will benefit from it. With the help of each new in­
vention they will be able to observe anew the face of our century and listen
to the sounds made by our generation. But who is able to project the Athens
of Euripides onto a screen or make heard the voice of Sappho ? "
He livened up and played with a large shell he had absentmindedly
taken off the chimney mantelpiece.
I appreciated the object that was to revive his spirits, and because I an­
ticipated that the elaboration of the scientific, if not paradoxical, theme
would amuse him, I resumed:
" Beware of despair. Nature frequently delights in anticipating science,
which in turn often merely imitates it. Take photography, for instance ! The
world can see the traces of an antediluvian creature in a museum-I believe
it is the brontosaurus-and the soil retains the marks of the rain that was
falling when the beast walked by. What a prehistoric snapshot! "
Nerval was holding the shell to his ear.
" Beautiful, the roaring of this stethoscope," he said; "it reminds me
of the beach where I found it-an island off Salerno . . . it is old and
crumbling. "54
Gramophone
I used the opportunity.
"Dear friend, who knows ? The pupils of the dying are said to retain the
last image they received . . . What if this ear-shaped snail stored the sounds
it heard at some critical moment-the agony of mollusks, maybe ? And
what if the rosy lips of its shell were to pass it on like a graphophone? All in
all, you may be listening to the surf of oceans centuries old . . . "
But Nerval had risen. With a commanding gesture he bid me be quiet.
His dizzy eyes opened as if over an abyss. He held the double-horned grotto
to his temple as if eavesdropping on the threshold of a mystery. A hypnotic
ecstasy rendered him motionless.
After I repeatedly insisted, he reluctantly handed me the shell.
At first I was only able to make out a gurgling of foam, then the hardly
audible turmoil of the open sea. I sensed-how I can not say-that the sea
was very blue and very ancient. And then, suddenly, women were singing
and passing by . . . inhuman women whose hymn was wild and lustful like
the scream of a crazed goddess . . . Yes, Doctor, that's how it was: a scream
and yet a hymn. These were the insidious songs Circe warned us not to lis­
ten to, or only when tied to the mast of a galley with rowers whose ears are
filled with wax . . . But was that really enough to protect oneself from the
danger? . . .
I continued to listen.
The sea creatures disappeared into the depths of the shell. And yet
minute by minute the same maddening scene was repeated, periodically, as
if by phonograph, incessantly and never diminished.
Nerval snatched the shell away from me and ran to the piano. For a
long time he tried to write down the sexual screaming of the goddesses.
At two in the morning he gave up.
The room was strewn with blackened and torn sheets of music.
" You see, you see," he said to me, " not even when I am dictated to can
I transcribe the choir! . . . "
He slumped back into his chair, and despite my efforts, he continued to
listen to the poison of this Paean.
At four o'clock he started to tremble. I begged him to lie down. He
shook his head and seemed to lean over the invisible maelstrom.
At half past five Nerval fell against the marble chimney-he was dead.
The shell broke into a thousand pieces.
Do you believe that there are poisons for the ear modeled on deadly
perfumes or lethal potions? Ever since last Wednesday'S acoustic presenta­

There have been better questions to conclude fantastic tales. But in ways
both smooth and comical Renard's fantasy finds its way into technical
manuals. In
1902, in the first German monograph on Care and Usage of
Modern Speaking Machines (Phonograph, Graphophone and Gramo­
phone), Alfred Parzer-Miihlbacher promises that graphophones-a Co­
lumbia brand name also used by Renard-will be able to build " archives
and collections " for all possible " memories " :
Cherished loved ones, dear friends, and famous individuals who have long since
passed away will years later talk to us again with the same vividness and warmth;
the wax cylinders transport us back in time to the happy days of youth-we hear
the speech of those who lived countless years before us, whom we never knew,
and whose names were only handed down by history.67
Renard's narrator clarifies such " practical advice for interested cus­
tomers " by pointing out that the phonographic recording of dead friends
surpasses their " cinematographic" immortalization: instead of black-and­
white phantom doubles in the realm of the imaginary, bodies appear by
virtue of their voices in a real that once again can only b e measured in eu­
phemisms: by carrion or skeletons . It becomes possible to conjure up
friends as well a s the dead " whose names were only handed down by his­
tory. " Once technological media guarantee the similarity of the dead to
stored data by turning them into the latter's mechanical product, the
boundaries of the body, death and lust, leave the most indelible traces.
According to Renard, eyes retain final visions a s snapshots; according to
the scientific-psychological determinations of Benedict and Ribot,68 they
even retain these visions in the shape of time-lapse photography. And if, in
strict analogy, the roaring shell only replays its agony, then even the dead­
est of gods and goddesses achieve acoustic presence. The shell that Re­
nard's fictitious composer listens to was not found on a natural beach; it
takes the place of the mouthpieces of a telephone or a loudspeaker capa­
ble of bridging temporal distances in order to connect him with an antiq­
uity preceding all discourse. The sound emanating from such a receiver is
once again Rilke's primal sound, but as pure sexuality, as
divine clameur56
Gramophone
sexuelle. The "rosy lips" and the "double-horned grotto " of its anatomy
leave that in as little doubt as the death of the old man to whom they
appear.
Thus Renard's short story introduces a long series of literary phan­
tasms that rewrite eroticism itself under the conditions of gramophony
and telephony. As a result, apparitions no longer comprise those endear­
ing images of women whom, as Keller put it, the bitter world does not
nourish; instead, the temptation of a voice has become a new partial ob­
ject. In the same letter in which Kafka suggests to his fiancee and her par­
lograph firm that old-fashioned love letters be replaced by technical re­
lays of telephone and parlograph,69 he relates a dream:
Very late, dearest, and yet I shall go to bed without deserving it. Well, I won't
sleep anyway, only dream. As I did yesterday, for example, when in my dream I
ran toward a bridge or some balustrading, seized two telephone receivers that
happened to be lying on the parapet, put them to my ears, and kept asking for
nothing but news from "Pontus"; but nothing whatever came out of the telephone
except a sad, mighty, wordless song and the roar of the sea. Although well aware
that it was impossible for voices to penetrate these sounds, I didn't give in, and
didn't go awayJo
News from "Pontus"-as Gerhard Neumann has shown,71 in pretechni­
cal days this was news from Ovid's Black Sea exile, the quintessential
model for literature as a love letter. Letters of this kind, necessarily re­
ceived or written in their entirety by women, were replaced by the tele­
phone and its noise, which precedes all discourse and subsequently all
whole individuals. In La voix humaine, Cocteau's one-act telephone play
of 1930, a man and a woman at either end of a telephone line agree to
burn their old love letters.72 The new eroticism is like that of the gramo­
phone, which, as Kafka remarked in the same letter, one "can't under­
stand. "73 "The telephone conversation occupies the middle ground be­
tween the rendezvous and the love letter" :74 it drowns out the meaning of
words with a physiological presence that no longer allows "human
voices" to get through, as well as by superimposing a myriad of simulta­
neous conversations, which in Kafka's The Castle, for instance, reduces
the "continual telephoning" to "humming and singing."75 Likewise, in
Renard's short story the superimposition of all the goddesses and sirens
that ever existed may have resulted in white noise.
There can be no doubt that Kafka dreamed telephony in all its infor­
mational and technological precision: four days prior to his dream he
read an essay by Philipp Reis in an 1 8 63 issue of Die Gartenlaube on theGramophone
57
first telephone experiments.76 As i s clear from the essay's title, "The Mu­
sic Telegraph, " the apparatus was built for the purpose of conveying the
human voice. It failed to do SO,77 but like Kafka's imagined telephone
mouthpieces it was capable of transmitting music.
Ever since Freud, psychoanalysis has been keeping a list of partial ob­
jects that, first, can be separated from the body and, second, excite desires
prior to sexual differentiation: breast, mouth, and feces. Lacan added two
further partial obj ects: voice and gaze.78 This is psychoanalysis in the me­
dia age, for only cinema can restore the disembodied gaze, and only the
telephone was able to transmit a disembodied voice. Plays like Cocteau's
La voix humaine follow in their wake.
The only thing that remains unclear is whether media advertise par­
tial objects or partial objects advertise the postal system. The more strate­
gic the function of news channels, the more necessary, at least in interim
peace times, the recruitment of users.
In 1980 Dieter Wellershoff published his novella The Siren, unfortu­
nately without dedicating it to Renard. A professor from Cologne plans to
use his sabbatical to finally complete his long-planned book on commu­
nication theory. But he never gets down to writing. An unknown woman
who once witnessed Professor Elsheimer's telegenic partial objects on a
TV screen starts a series of phone calls that begin like a one-sided suicide
hot line and culminate in mutual telephonic masturbation.79 Written the­
ories of communication stand no chance against the self-advertisement of
technological media. Even the most taciturn of European "civil services" 80
recruited for "the profession of telephone operator" and made it " acces­
sible to German women, " because from the very beginning its "telephone
service" could not "do without" the "clear voices of women. " 81
Therefore, Professor Elsheimer's only means of escaping the spell of
the telephonic-sexual mouthpiece is to use one medium to beat another
medium. During the last call from the unseen siren he puts on a Bach
record and pumps up the volume. 82 And 10 and behold, drowned out by
Old European notated music the siren magic ceases to exist. Only two
technical media communicate between Cologne and Hamburg. "Here,"
Kafka wrote from Prague to his beloved employee of a phonograph man­
ufacturer, "by the way, is a rather nice idea; a parlograph goes to the tele­
phone in Berlin, while a gramophone does likewise in Prague, and these
two carry on a little conversation with each other. " 83
Wellershoff's The Siren is an inverted replay of "The Man and the
Shell. " Renard's fictional composer had not yet acquired the technologi­
cal skill to employ, of all pieces, the Art of the Fugue as a jammer in the58

war of the sexes. On the contrary, he wanted to transfer onto musical
sheets what was no longer fugue or art: "a goddess's lusty scream, "
which coincided with the roaring of the sea.
It remained an impossible wish as long as it depended on the five
lines of a musical staff, but that changed in the founding age of modern
media. In the beginning there was, as always, Wagner, who, by courtesy
of ice-cream poisoning in La Spezia, experienced an acoustic fever delir­
ium of "swiftly running water" that suggested to him the Rhinegold pre­
lude. 84 Debussy's Sirenes for orchestra and female voices followed inGramophone
59
1 89 5 , the score o f which n o longer dictated words, o r even syllables or
vowels, but sums, as if it were possible to compose the noise of channels
or, as Richard Dehmel put it a year later, the "hollow din" of the "tele­
graph wires. " 85 Between 1903 and 1905 Debussy completed the "sym­
phonic poem" which in Renard's tale was named after a Greek sea god­
dess but which Debussy simply called La Mer. Finally, in 1907 Wagner's
monotonous, ice cream-induced E-flat chord with all its overtone effects
became Nerval's unwritten Amphitrite, that "poison for the ear. "
Berliner's gramophone is to the history of music what Edison's phono­
graph is to the history of literature. At the price of being monopolized and
mass produced by big industry, records globalized musical noise. Edison's
cylinders in turn made the storage of speech a daily enjoyment, even if in
each case only a very few copies could be made. As a result, literature's
letter-filled papers suffered the same crisis as sheet music.
In 19 16, three years before Rilke's "Primal Sound, " Salomo Friedlaend­
er delineated the new constellation of eroticism, literature, and phonog­
raphy. More than any other writer of his time, Friedlaender, better known
under the pseudonym Mynona (a palindrome of anonym), made stories
again out of media history. In 19 22 he published the novel Gray Magic,
which anticipates a technological future in which women are turned into
celluloid (and men, incidentally, into typewriters). In 19 16 he wrote a short

THE P H O N O GRAPH " ( 19 1 6 )
"What a pity," remarked Anna Pomke, a timid middle-class girl, "that the
phonograph wasn't already invented in 1 8001 "
"Why? " asked Professor Abnossah Pschorr. "Dear Pomke, it is a pity
that Eve didn't present it to Adam as part of her dowry for their common­
law marriage; there is a lot to feel pity for, dear Pomke."
"Oh, Professor, I would have loved to listen to Goethe's voicel He is
said to have had such a beautiful organ, and everything he said was so
meaningful. Oh, if only he could have spoken into a phonographl Ohl Ohl"
Long after Pomke had left, Abnossah, who had a weakness for her60
Gramophone
squeaky chubbiness, still heard her groans. Professor Pschorr, inventor of
the telestylus, immersed himself in his customary inventive thoughts. Was
it possible retroactively to trick that Goethe (Abnossah was ridiculously
jealous) out of his voice ? Whenever Goethe spoke, his voice produced vi­
brations as harmonious as, for example, the soft voice of your wife, dear
Reader. These vibrations encounter obstacles and are reflected, resulting in a
to and fro which becomes weaker in the passage of time but which does not
actually cease. So the vibrations produced by Goethe are still in existence,
and to bring forth Goethe's voice you only need the proper receiver to re­
cord them and a microphone to amplify their effects, by now diminished.
The difficult part was the construction of the receiver. How could it be ad­
justed to the specific vibrations of Goethe's voice without having the latter at
one's disposal? What a fascinating idea! Abnossah determined that it was
necessary to conduct a thorough study of Goethe's throat. He scrutinized
busts and portraits, but they provided a very vague impression at best. He
was on the verge of giving up when he suddenly remembered that Goethe
was still around, if only in the shape of a corpse. He immediately sent a peti­
tion to Weimar asking for permission to briefly inspect Goethe's remains for
the purpose of certain measurements. The petition was rejected. What now?
Furnished with a small suitcase filled with the most delicate measuring
and burglary equipment, Abnossah Pschorr proceeded to dear old Weimar;
incidentally, in the first-class waiting room he happened to come across the
locally known sister of the globally known brother in graceful conversation
with some old Highness of Rudolfstadt. Abnossah heard her say, " Our Fritz
always had a military posture, and yet he was gentle; with others he was of
truly Christian tenderness-how he would have welcomed this war! And
the beautiful, sacred book by Max Scheler! "
Abnossah was s o shocked he fell flat on his back. He pulled himself up
with difficulty and found lodgings in the " Elephant. " In his room he care­
fully examined the instruments. Then he placed a chair in front of the mir­
ror and tried on nothing less than a surprisingly portrait-like mask of the
old Goethe. He tied it to his face and exclaimed:
"Verily, you know I am a genius,
"I may well be Goethe himself!
" Step aside, buffoon! Else I call Schiller and my prince Karl August for
help, you oaf, you substitute ! "
He rehearsed his speech with a deep sonorous voice.
Late at night he proceeded to the royal tomb. Modern burglars, all of
whom I desire as my readers, will smile at those other readers who believe
that it is impossible to break into the well-guarded Weimar royal tomb.Gramophone

Please remember that a s a burglar Professor Pschorr i s ahead o f even the
most adept professional burglar. Pschorr is not only a most proficient engi­
neer, he is also a psychophysiologist, a hypnotist, a psychologist, and a psy­
choanalyst. In general, it is a pity that there are so few educated criminals:
if all crimes were successful, they would finally belong to the natural order
of things and incur the same punishment as any other natural event. Who
takes lightning to task for melting Mr. Meier's safe? Burglars such as
Pschorr are superior to lightning because they are not diverted by rods.
In a single moment, Pschorr was able to give rise to horror and then im­
mobilize those frozen in terror by using hypnosis. Imagine yourself guarding
the royal tomb at midnight: suddenly the old Goethe appears and casts a spell
on you that leaves only your head alive. Pschorr turned the whole guard into
heads attached to trunks in suspended animation. He had about two hours
before the cramp loosened, and he made good use of them. He descended
into the tomb, switched on a flashlight, and soon found Goethe's sarcopha­
gus. After a short while he was acquainted with the corpse. Piety is for those
who have no other worries. It should not be held against Pschorr that he sub­
jected Goethe's cadaver to some practical treatment; in addition, he made
some wax molds and finally ensured that everything was restored to its previ­
ous state. Educated amateur criminals may be more radical than profession­
als, but the radicalness of their meticulous accomplishments furnishes their
crimes with the aesthetic charm of a perfectly solved mathematical equation.
After leaving the tomb Pschorr added further elegance to his precision
by deliberately freeing a guard from his spell and scolding him in the afore­
mentioned manner. Then he tore the mask off his face and returned to the
" Elephant" in the most leisurely fashion. He was satisfied; he had what he
wanted. Early next morning he returned home.
A most active period of work began. As you know, a body can be re­
constructed by using its skeleton; or at least Pschorr was able to do so. The
exact reproduction of Goethe's air passage down to the vocal cords and
lungs no longer posed any insurmountable difficulties. The timbre and
strength of the sounds produced by these organs could be determined with
utmost precision-you merely had to let a stream of air corresponding to
the measurement of Goethe's lungs pass through. After a short while Goethe
spoke the way he must have spoken during his lifetime.
But since it was not only a matter of recreating his voice but also of
having this voice repeat the words it uttered a hundred years ago, it was
necessary to place Goethe's dummy in a room in which those words had fre­
quently been spoken.
Abnossah invited Pomke. She came and laughed at him delightfully.62
Gramophone
"Do you want to hear him speak? "
" Whom? "
"That Goethe o f yours. "
"Of mine ? Well, I never! Professor ! "
" So you do ! "
Abnossah cranked the phonograph and a voice appeared:
"Friends, oh flee the darkened chamber . . . " et cetera.
Pomke was strangely moved.
"Yes," she said hastily, " that is exactly how I imagined his organ. It is
so enchanting! "
" Well, now, " cried Pschorr, " I d o not want to deceive you, my dear.
Yes, it is Goethe, his voice, his words. But it is not an actual replay of words
he actually spoke. What you heard was the repetition of a possibility, not of
a reality. I am, however, determined to fulfill your wish in its entirety and
therefore propose a j oint excursion to Weimar. "
The locally known sister of the globally known brother was again sitting
in the waiting room whispering to an elderly lady: "There still remains a fi­
nal work by my late brother, but it will not be published until the year
2000.
The world is not yet mature enough. My brother inherited his ancestor's pi­
ous reverence. But our world is frivolous and would not see the difference
between a satyr and this saint. The little people in Italy saw a saint in him. "
Pomke would have keeled over if Pschorr had not caught her. He
blushed oddly and she gave him a charming smile. They drove straight to
the Goethehaus. Hofrat Professor Bbffel did the honors. Pschorr presented
his request. Bbffel became suspicious. " You have brought along a dummy of
Goethe's larynx, a mechanical apparatus? Is that what you are saying? "
"And I request permission to install it i n Goethe's study. "
"Of course. But for what reason? What do you want? What is this sup­
posed to mean? The newspapers are full of something curious, nobody
knows what to make of it. The guards claim to have seen the old Goethe, he
even roared at one of them. The others were so dazed by the apparition they
were in need of medical attention. The incident was reported to the Arch­
duke himself. "
Anna Pomke scrutinized Pschorr. Abnossah, however, was astonished.
"But what has this got to do with my request? Granted, it is very strange ­
maybe some actor allowed himself a joke . "
"Ah! You are right, that i s a n explanation worth exploring. I couldn't
help but think . . . But how were you able to imitate Goethe's larynx, since
you could not have possibly modeled it after nature ? "Gramophone
63
"That i s what I would have preferred t o do, but I was unfortunately
not given the permission . "
"I assume that i t would not have been very helpful anyway. "
" Why? "
"To the best o f my knowledge Goethe i s dead."
"I assure you, the skeleton, in particular the skull, would suffice to as­
semble a precise model; at least it would suffice for me. "
"Your skill i s well known, Professor. But what d o you need the larynx
for, if I may ask ? "
" I want to reproduce the timbre o f the Goethean organ a s deceptively
close to nature as possible. "
"And you have the model ? "
"Here ! "
Abnossah snapped open a case. Bbffel uttered a n odd scream. Pomke
smiled proudly.
"But you could not have modeled this larynx on the skeleton ? " cried
Bbffe!'
"Almost! It is based on certain life-size and lifelike busts and pictures; I
am very skilled in these matters . "
"As we all know! But why d o you want to set u p this model in Goethe's
former study? "
"He conceivably articulated certain interesting things there; and be­
cause the acoustic vibration of his words, though naturally in an extremely
diminished state, are still to be found there -"
"You believe so? "
"It's not a question of belief, it's a fact. "
"Yes ? "
"Yes ! "
"So what d o you want to do ? "
"I want to suck those vibrations through the larynx . "
"Pardon me ? "
" What I just told you ! "
" What a n idea-1 apologize, but you can hardly expect me to take this
seriously. "
" Which is why I have to insist all the more forcefully that you give me
the opportunity to convince you of the seriousness of this matter. I am at a
loss to understand your resistance; after all, this harmless machine won't
cause any damage! "
"I'm sure it won't. I am not at all resisting you, but I am officially64
Gramophone
obliged to ask you a number of questions. I do hope you won't hold it
against me ? "
" Heaven forbid! "
In the presence of Anna Pomke, Professor Boffel, and a couple of curi­
ous assistants and servants, the following scene unfolded in Goethe's study:
Pschorr placed his model on a tripod, ensuring that the mouth occupied
the same position as Goethe's had when he was sitting. Then Pschorr pulled
a kind of rubber air cushion out of his pocket and closed the nose and
mouth of the model with one of its ends. He unfolded the cushion and
spread it like a blanket over a small table he had pulled up to the tripod. On
this blanket (as it were) he placed a most enchanting miniature phonograph
complete with microphone that he had removed from his case. He now care­
fully wrapped the blanket around the phonograph, leaving a second opening
facing the mouth in the shape of an end into which he screwed a pair of bel­
lows. These, he explained, were not to blow air into but to suck it out of the
mouth.
When I, as it were, let the nasopharyngeal cavity exhale as it does dur­
ing speech, Pschorr lectured, this specifically Goethean larynx functions like
a sieve that only lets through the acoustic vibrations of Goethe's voice, if
there are any; and there are bound to be. The machine is equipped with an
amplifier should they be weak.
The buzz of the recording phonograph could be heard inside the rubber
cushion. And then an inescapable feeling of horror upon hearing an indis­
tinct, barely audible whispering. " Oh, my God! " Pomke said, holding her
delicate ear against the rubber skin. She started. A rasping murmur came
from the inside: "As I have said, my dear Eckermann, this Newton was
blind with his seeing eyes. How often, my friend, do we catch sight of this
when faced with something that appears to be so obvious! Therefore it is in
particular the eye and its perceptions which demand the fullest attention of
our critical faculties. Without these we cannot arrive at any sensible conclu­
sion. Yet the world mocks judgment, it mocks reason. What it, in truth, de­
sires is uncritical sensation. Many a time have I painfully experienced this,
yet I have not grown tired of contradicting the world and, in my own way,
setting my words against Newton's. "
Pomke heard this with jubilant horror. She trembled and said: "Divine!
Divine! Professor, l owe to you the most beautiful moment of my life . "
"Did you hear something? "
" Certainly. Quiet, but very distinct! "
Pschorr nodded contentedly. H e worked the bellows for a little while
and then said, "That should be enough for now. "Gramophone
65
H e put all the instruments back into his case with the exception of the
phonograph. All those present were eager and excited. BbHel asked, "Pro­
fessor, do you honestly believe that you have actually captured words once
spoken by Goethe ? Real echoes from Goethe's own mouth? "
" I d o not only believe so, I am certain of it. I will now replay the
phonograph with the microphone and predict that you will have to agree
with me. "
The familiar hissing, hemming, and squeezing. Then the sound o f a re­
markable voice that electrified everybody, including Abnossah. They listened
to the words quoted above. Then it continued: "Oh ho! So, he, Newton,
saw it! Did he indeed? The continuous color spectrum? I, dear friend, I shall
reiterate that he was deceived: that he was witness to an optical illusion and
accepted it uncritically, glad to resume his counting and measuring and
splitting of hairs. To hell with his monism, his continuity; it is precisely the
contrast of colors that makes them appear in the first place! Eckermann!
Eckermann! Hold your horses! White-neither does it yield any color nor
do other colors add up to white. Rather, in order to obtain gray, white must
be mechanically combined with black, and it has to be chemically united
with gray to produce the varied gray of the other colors. You will never ob­
tain white by neutralizing colors. It merely serves to restore the original con­
trast of black and white: and of course white is the only one that can be
seen in all its brightness. But I, dear friend, I see darkness just as clearly, and
if Newton only hit upon white, I, most esteemed comrade, also hit upon
black. I should think that a former archer like yourself would greatly appre­
ciate such a feat! That is the way it is, and so be it! From me our distant
grandchildren and great-grandchildren populating this absurd world will
learn to laugh at Newton! "
BbHel had sat down while everybody was cheering. The servants tram­
pled with delight, like students in the fiery lectures of that upright and de­
monic graybeard, the smashingly revolutionary, lordly Reucken. But Abnos­
sah sternly said, " Gentlemen! You are interrupting Goethe! He isn't finished
yet! "
Silence resumed and the voice continued: "No, Sir, no and again no ! Of
course you could have if you had so desired! It is the will, the will of these
Newtonians, that is pernicious; and a faulty will is a corruptive faculty, an
active inability that I abhor even though I catch sight of it everywhere and
should be accustomed to it. You may consider it harmless, but the will is
the true contriver of all things great and small; it is not the divine power
but the will, the divine will, that thwarts man and proves his inadequacy. If
you were able to desire in a godlike way, dear friend, the ability would be66
Gramophone
necessary and not j ust easy to come by, and a lot of what now dare not
show its face for fear of meeting hostility or ridicule would become every­
day experience.
" Consider young Schopenhauer, a lad of supreme promise, full of the
most magnificent desires, but afflicted by the rot of abundance, by his own
insatiability. In the theory of colors he was blinded by the sun to the extent
that he did not accept the night as another sun but rather deemed it null
and void; likewise, he was captivated by the luster of life in its wholeness, in
contrast to which human life struck him as worthless. Behold, Sir, that the
purest, most divine will is in danger of failure if it is bent on persisting at all
cost; if it is not prepared to wisely and gracefully take into account the exte­
rior conditions as well as the limitations of its own means ! Indeed: the will
is indeed a magician! Is there anything it cannot do ? But the human will is
not a will, it is a bad will. Ha! Haha! Hee! Hee ! "
Goethe laughed mysteriously and continued in a whisper:
"Very well then, my dearest friend, I shall entrust, indeed reveal, some­
thing to you. You will judge it a fairy tale, but to me it has attained the ut­
most clarity. Your own will can vanquish fate; it can make fate its servant
provided-and now listen closely-it does not presume that the tremendous
and divinely tense creative intent and exertion within should also be clearly
manifest without, especially in a most intense display of muscular strain.
Behold earth as it is turned and driven! What mundane industry! What
ceaseless motion! But mark my words, Eckermann! It is no more than mun­
dane diligence, nothing but a fatally mechanical driving-while the vibrat­
ing, magical will of the sun rests within itself and by virtue of this supreme
self-sufficiency gives rise to the electromagnetism that humbles the whole
army of planets, moons, and comets into servile submission at its feet. 0
friend, to understand, to experience and be, in the most serenely spiritual
sense of the word, that sublime culprit!-Enough, let us leave it at that. I
was accustomed to discipline myself whenever I heard others, and some­
times even Schiller, rhapsodize freely, out of love for such a divine activity,
in the face of which one should be silent, because all discourse would not
only be useless and superfluous but indeed harmful and obstructive by
creating a ridiculously profane understanding, if not the most decisive
misunderstanding. Remember this, my friend, and keep it in your heart
without attempting to unravel the mystery! Trust that in time it will
unravel itself, and this evening go to the theater with Little Wolf, who
is eager to go, and do not treat Kotzebue too harshly even though he
disgusts us ! "
" Oh, God," Pomke said, while the others eagerly congratulatedGramophone
67
Abnossah, " oh, God ! If only I could listen forever! How much Eckermann
withheld from us ! "
After a long while a snoring emanated from the machine, then nothing!
" Gentlemen! " Abnossah said, " as you can hear, Goethe is obviously asleep.
It makes little sense to wait around; there is nothing to expect for a couple
of hours, if not for an entire day. Staying around is useless. As you no doubt
realize, the apparatus adheres closely to real time. In the most fortunate case
we might hear something should Eckermann have returned to Goethe fol­
lowing the performance. I, for one, do not have the time to wait around for
that to happen. "
"How i s it," the slightly skeptical Bbffel asked, "that, o f all speeches,
we were able to listen to this one ? "
"Pure chance, " Pschorr responded. "The conditions, i n particular the
makeup of the machine and its positioning, happened to correspond to these
and no other sound vibrations. I only took into account the fact that Goethe
was sitting and the location of his chair. "
" Oh, please, please! Abnossah! " (pomke, almost maenadic, was as if in
a trance; for the first time she called him by his first name. ) " Try it some­
where else! I can't hear enough of it-and even if it is only snoring! "
Abnossah put away the machine and locked the suitcase. He had
become very pale: "My dear Anna-Madame," he corrected himself,
"-another time . " (Jealousy of the old Goethe was eating him up inside. )
"How about Schiller's skull ? " Bbffel asked. "It would decide the dis­
pute over whether it is the real one . "
"Indeed," Abnossah responded, " for i f w e heard Schiller, the Swab ian,
say in a broad Hessian accent, 'How about a glass of wine ? ' it wouldn't be
Schiller's skull.-I am wondering if the invention couldn't be refined. Maybe
I could manufacture a generic larynx that could be adjusted like an opera
glass in order to be aligned with all kinds of possible vibrations. We could
listen to antiquity and the Middle Ages and determine the correct pronunci­
ation of old idioms. And respected fellow citizens who say indecent things
out loud could be handed over to the police. "
Abnossah offered Pomke his arm and they returned to the station. They
cautiously entered the waiting room, but the locally known one had already
left. " What if she let me have the larynx of her famous brother? But she
won't do it; she'll claim that the people aren't mature enough and that the
literati lack the reverence of the people, and that nothing can be done.
Beloved! Beloved! For (oh!) that! That is ! That is what you are ! "
But Pomke wasn't listening. She appeared to be dreaming.
" How he stresses the rs ! " she whispered apprehensively.68
Gramophone
Abnossah angrily blew his nose; Anna started and asked him distract­
edly: " You were saying, dear Pschorr ? ! I am neglecting the master for his
work! But the world subsides when I hear Goethe's own voice! "
They boarded the coach for their return journey. Pomke said nothing;
Abnossah was brooding silently. After they had passed Halle, he threw the
little suitcase with Goethe's larynx out of the window in front of an ap­
proaching train. " What have you done ? " Pomke shrieked.
"Loved," Pschorr sighed, " and soon I will have lived-and destroyed
my victorious rival, Goethe's larynx. "
Pomke blushed furiously; laughing, she threw herself vigorously into
Abnossah's tightly embracing arms. At that moment the conductor entered
and requested the tickets.
" God! Nossah! " murmured Pomke. " You have to get me a new larynx
of Goethe, you have to -or else -"
"No or else ! Apres les noces, my dove ! "

Just married
Currently at the "Elephant" in Weimar
This wedding announcement is truly a happy ending: it puts an end to
Classic-Romantic p oetry. In
I9 I6
even " timid middle-class girls" like
Anna Pomke come under the influence of professors like Pschorr, who as
one of the " most proficient" engineers of his day obviously teaches at the
new technological institutes so vigorously promoted by Emperor Wilhelm
II. Marriage to an engineer vanquishes the middle-class girl's infatuation
with Goethe, which lyceums had been systematically drilling into them
for over a century.86 What disappears is nothing less than
The Determi­
nation of Women for Higher Intellectual Development. Under this title, a
certain Amalie Holst demanded in I 802 the establishment of girls'
schools responsible for turning women into mothers and readers of po­
ets.87 Without the Anna Pomkes there would have been no German Clas­
sicism, and none of its principally male authors would have risen to fame.
Consequently, Pomke can only think of the old century when con­
fronted with the technological innovations of the new one. As if to prove
that the Soul or Woman of Classicism and Romanticism was an effect of
automata, she laments the unstored disappearance of Goethe's voice withGramophone

the very same sigh, "oh" (ach), uttered by the talking robot Olympia in
Hoffmann's Sandman, a sigh that, though it is the only word it can speak,
suffices to underscore its soul. In Hegel's words, a female sigh, or a "dis­
appearance of being in the act of being, " loves a male poetic capability,
or a " disappearance of being in the act of being." And as if to prove that
the voice is a partial object, Pomke praises Goethe's voice as "a beautiful
organ." Which not coincidentally makes the "psychiatrist" and "psycho­
analyst" Professor Pschorr "jealous," for all the power Classical authors
had over their female readers rested in the erection of that organ.
Not that middle-class girls were able to hear their master's voice.
There were no phonographs " around 1 8 00," and therefore none of the
canine obedience for a real that became the trademark of Berliner's
gramophone company in 1902. Unlike that of Nipper, the dog that
started sniffing at the bell-mouth of the phonograph upon hearing its
dead master's voice, and whose vocal-physiological loyalty was captured
in oil by the painter Francis Barraud, the brother of the deceased, the loy­
alty of female Classic-Romantic readers was restricted to the imaginary­
to their so-called imagination. They were forced to hallucinate Goethe's
voice between the silent lines of his writing. It was not a coincidence that
Friedrich Schlegel wrote to a woman and lover that " one seems to hear
what one is merely reading." In order for Schlegel wholly to become an
author himself, women had to become readers and "appreciate the sa­
credness of words more than in the past. "ss
"To the extent that graphism"-that is, in the shape of alphabetic
writing-"is flattened onto the voice" (while in tribal cultures "it was in-70
Gramophone
scribed flush with the body" ) , " body representation subordinates itself to
word representation. " But this "flattening induces a fictitious voice from
on high that no longer expresses itself except in the linear flux, " 89 be­
cause at least since Gutenberg it has announced the decrees of national
bureaucracies.
Thus Anna Pomke's loving sigh confirms the theory of media and
writing of the Anti-Oedipus.
Once the beautiful and fictitious, monstrous and unique organ of the
poet-bureaucrat Goethe, which commanded an entire literary epoch, rose
as an acoustic hallucination from the lines of his poems, things proceeded
as desired. In 1 8 19, Hoffmann's fairy tale Little Zaches noted what "ex­
travagant poets . . . ask for" : "First of all, they want the young lady to get
into a state of somnambulistic rapture over everything they utter, to sigh
deeply, roll her eyes, and occasionally to faint a trifle, or even to go blind
for a moment at the peak of the most feminine femininity. Then the afore­
said young lady must sing the poet's songs to the melody that streams
forth from her heart" 90 and, finally, in the Anti-Oedipus, reveal the secret
of its media technology: that it is a fictitious elevated phallus born from
the alphabet.
For timid middle-class girls, however, everything depended on liter­
ally going " blind" when faced with the materiality of printed letters; oth­
erwise, they could not have provided them with a melody in the imagi­
nary (or at the piano) from their hearts. In doing so, they surrendered un­
conditionally to the desires of Classic-Romantic poets. "Oh, " Anna
Pomke sighs from the bottom of her heart, "if only he could have spoken
into a phonograph! Oh! Oh! "
A sigh that will hardly reach the ears of engineers. Pschorr can only
discern a "groan" in her " oh," mere vocal physiology instead of a heart.
Around 1900, love's wholeness disintegrates into the partial obj ects of
particular drives identified by Freud. Phonographs do not only store ­
like Kempelen's vowel machine or Hoffmann's Olympia-the one signi­
fied, or trademark, of the soul. They are good for any kind of noise, from
Edison's hearing-impaired screaming to Goethe's fine organ. With the
demise of writing's storage monopoly comes to an end a love that was not
only one of literature's many possible subjects but also its very own media
technology: since 1 800 perfectly alphabetized female readers have been
able to endow letters with a beloved voice. But tracing primal sounds has,
as Rilke put it, nothing to do with "the presence of mind and grace of
love."
As a modern engineer who wants to spread his knowledge usingGramophone
71
everyday language, Professor Pschorr minces n o words: " Whenever
Goethe spoke, his voice produced vibrations as harmonious as, for exam­
ple, the soft voice of your wife, dear Reader. " However, the fact that
what Goethe had to say was "meaningful" enough to fill the 144 volumes
of the GroiSherzogin-Sophien edition is irrelevant. Once again notions of
frequency are victorious over works, heartfelt melodies, and signifieds. As
if commenting on Pschorr, Rudolph Lothar writes at the outset of his The
Talking Machine: A Technical-Aesthetic Essay:
Everything flows, Heraclitus says, and in light of our modern worldview we may
add: everything flows in waves. Whatever happens in the world, whatever we call
life or history, whatever occurs as a natural phenomenon-everything transpires
in the shape of waves.
Rhythm is the most supreme and sacred law of the universe; the wave phe­
nomenon is the primal and universal phenomenon.
Light, magnetism, electricity, temperature, and finally sound are nothing but
wave motions, undulations, or vibrations . . . .
The unit of measurement for all wave motions is the meter, the unit of time
is the second. Frequencies are the vibrations registered within a meter per second.
The frequencies of light, electricity, and magnetism are taken to be identical; with
approximately 700 trillion vibrations per second, their speed of propagation is
300 million meters per second.
Sound vibrations exhibit significantly lower frequencies than those described
above. The speed of propagation for sound is 3 3 2 meters per second. The deepest
sound audible to human ears hovers around 8 vibrations, the highest around
40,000.91
The new appreciation of waves, those very un-Goethean "primal and
universal phenomena," can even result in a poetry that once more stresses
the wavelike nature of all that occurs, as in the sonnet " Radio Wave,"
which the factory carpenter Karl August Diippengiesser of Stolberg sub­
mitted to Radio Cologne in 19 28:
Wave, b e aware o f your many shapes,
and, all-embracing, weave
at the world's wheel, entrusted from above,
the new and wider spirit of the human race.92
But engineers like Pschorr are ahead of " other people," even radio wave
poets: their "spirits hail"-to quote the engineer-poet Max Eyth-"not
from the world that was but from the one that will be." It is more efficient
to use waves "to make things that were never made before"93 than to
write sonnets about their many shapes. Pschorr makes use of laws of na-72
Gramophone
ture that, unlike the Panta rei of Heraclitus or of Goethe's "Permanence
in Transition, " are valid regardless of the reputation of so-called person­
alities, because they are based on measurements. The law of waves does
not exclude the author of "Permanence in Transition." And because the
frequency spectrum and transmission speed of sound are so low, they are
easy to measure. (To posthumously film Goethe would require technolo­
gies capable of recording in the terahertz range.)
With mathematical precision Pschorr recognizes the frequency of hu­
man voices to be a negative exponential function whose value, even after
centuries, cannot be zero. In the phonographic realm of the dead, spirits
are always present-as sound signal amplitudes "in an extremely dimin­
ished state. " " Speech has become, as it were, immortal," Scientific Amer­
ican pronounced immediately after Edison's invention under the headline,
"A Wonderful Invention-Speech Capable of Infinite Repetitions from
Automatic Records. " 94
But although he invented a relatively sensitive powder microphone
(as opposed to Hughes's carbon microphone), Edison was not able to ac­
cess the dead. Because it was only equipped with a mechanical amplifier,
his phonograph could do no more than record the last gasps of the dy­
ing-by using resonance in the recording bell-mouth. The low voltage
output of his microphone was increased somewhat by a relayed inductive
circuit, but it never approached the recording needle of the phonograph.
Goethe's bass frequencies, vibrating in infinity between roo and 400 hertz
in his Weimar abode, remained unmeasurable. A catastrophic signal-to­
noise ratio would have rendered all recordings worthless and, at best,
provided primal sounds instead of Goethean diction.
Pschorr's optimism, therefore, rests on more advanced technologies.
"A microphone to amplify" the "by now diminished" effects of Goethe's
voice depends upon the necessary but suppressed premise that infinite am­
plification factors could be applied. This became possible with Lieben's
work of 1906 and De Forest's of 1907. Lieben's controlled hot-cathode
tube, in which the amplitude fluctuations of a speech signal influence the
cathode current, and De Forest's audion detector, which added a third
electrode to the circuit, stood at the beginning of all radio technology.95
The electrification of the gramophone is due to them as well. Pschorr's
miraculous microphone could only have worked with the help of tube-type
technology. Short stories of 19 16 require the most up-to-date technologies.
Pschorr has other problems. His concerns revolve around filtering,
not amplification. Isolated from the word salad produced by visitors to
the Goethehaus from Schiller to Kafka, his beloved is supposed to receiveGramophone
73
only her master's voice. Pschorr's solution is as simple as it is Rilkean: he,
too, links media technology and physiology, that is, a phonograph and a
skull. As the first precursor of the revolutionary media poets Brecht and
Enzensberger, Pschorr assumes that transmitter and receiver are in prin­
ciple reversible: just as "every transistor radio is, by the nature of its con­
struction, at the same time a potential transmitter, " 96 and, conversely, any
microphone a potential miniature speaker, even Goethe's larynx can be
operated in normal and inverse fashion. Since speaking is no more than
the physiological filtering of breath or noise, and the entry and exit of
band-pass filters are interchangeable, the larynx will admit only those fre­
quency mixtures which once escaped from it.
The one thing left for Professor Pschorr to do to implement this se­
lectivity technologically is to grasp the difference between arts and media.
His early idea of fashioning a model of Goethe's larynx based on "pic­
tures and busts" is doomed to failure, simply because art, be it painting
or sculpture, only conveys "very vague impressions" of bodies.
Malte Laurids Brigge, the hero of Rilke's contemporaneous novel, is
asked by his father's doctors to leave the room while they (in accordance
with the master of the hunt's last request) perform a "perforation of the
heart" on the corpse. But Brigge stays and watches the operation. His rea­
son: "No, no, nothing in the world can one imagine beforehand, not the
least thing. Everything is made up of so many unique particulars that can­
not be foreseen. In imagination one passes them over and does not notice
that they are lacking, hasty as one is. But the realities are slow and inde­
scribably detailed. " 97
From imagination to data processing, from the arts to the particulars
of information technology and physiology-that is the historic shift of
1900 which Abnossah Pschorr must comprehend as well. He finds him­
self, not unlike Brigge at the deathbed of his father and Rilke at the
Parisian Ecole des Beaux-Arts, in the company of corpses. His profane il­
lumination, after all, is that " Goethe was still around, if only in the shape
of a corpse. " Once more, the real replaces the symbolic-those allegedly
" life-size and lifelike busts and pictures" that only a Goethehaus director
such as Hofrat Boffel could mistake for anatomical exhibits.
The reconstructed respiratory system of a corpse as a band-pass fil­
ter, a microphone- and tube-type-enhanced phonograph as a storage me­
dium-Pschorr is ready to go to work. He has engineered a crucial link
between physiology and technology, the principal connection that served
as the basis for Rilke's "Primal Sound" and all media conceptions at the
turn of the century. Only today's ubiquitous digitization can afford to74
Gramophone
do without such "radicalness," which in Pschorr's case consisted in short­
circuiting "cadavers" and machines. Once the stochastics of the real al­
low for encipherment, that is to say, for algorithms, Turing's laconic state­
ment that there would be "little point in trying to make a 'thinking ma­
chine' more human by dressing it up in artificial flesh"98 is validated.
In the founding days of media technology, however, everything cen­
tered on links between flesh and machine. In order to implement techno­
logically (and thus render superfluous) the functions of the central ner­
vous system, it first had to be reconstructed. Rilke's and Pschorr's projects
are far removed from fiction.
To begin with, Scott's membrane phonautograph of 1 8 5 7 was in all
its parts a reconstructed ear. The membrane was derived from the ear­
drum and the stylus with the attached bristle from the ossicle.99
Second, "in 1 839 the 'great Rhenish physiologist' and conversation
partner of Goethe, Johannes Muller, had removed the larynx from vari­
ous corpses-the acquisition of which tended to be rather adventurous
affairs-in order to study in concreto how specific vowel sounds were
produced. When Muller blew into a larynx, it sounded 'like a fairground
whistle with a rubber membrane.' Thus the real answered from dismem­
bered bodies." loo And thus, with his adventurous acquisition of parts of
Goethe's corpse from the sanctuary of the royal tomb, Pschorr perfected
experiments undertaken by Goethe's own conversation partner.
Third (and to remain close to Goethe and Pschorr), on September 6,
1 839, the Frankfurt birthplace of Germany's primal author witnessed a
bold experiment. Philipp Reis had just finished his second lecture on tele­
phone experiments when "Dr. Vogler, the savior of the Goethehaus and
founder of the Freie Deutsche Hochschulstift, presented the telephone to
Emperor Joseph of Austria and King Maximilian of Bavaria, who were
both in Frankfurt attending the royal council. " l O l As if the historic shift
from literature to media technology had to be localized.
But as Reis himself wrote, his telephone produced "the vibrations of
curves that were identical to those of a sound or a mixture of sounds, "
since " our ear can only perceive what can b e represented b y similar
curves; and this, in turn, is sufficient to make us conscious of any sound or
mixture of sounds. " However, in spite of all theoretical lucidity, Reis "had
not been able to reproduce a human voice with sufficient clarity. " 102 Which
is why, fourthly and finally, Alexander Graham Bell had to intervene.
A telephone ready for serial production and capable of transmitting
not just Reis's musical telegraphy or Kafka's sound of the sea but speeches
"in a clarity satisfactory to most everybody" did not exist until 1 876.Gramophone
75
Two years earlier, the technician Bell, son of a phonetician, had consulted
a physiologist and otologist. Clarence John Blake, MD, acquired two
middle ears from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. And once Bell
realized that "such a thin and delicate membrane " as the eardrum "could
move bones that were, relatively to it, very massive indeed, " the techno­
logical breakthrough was achieved. "At once the conception of a mem­
brane speaking telephone became complete in my mind; for I saw that a
similar instrument to that used as a transmitter could also be employed
as a receiver. " 103
It is precisely this interchangeability which decades later was to strike
Pschorr, Brecht, Enzensberger, e tutti quanti. Which is why Bell and Blake
did not hesitate to undertake the last step: in the course of a single exper­
imental procedure they coupled technology with physiology, steel with
flesh, a phonautograph with body parts. Wherever phones are ringing, a
ghost resides in the receiver.
And there is no reason to spare the most illustrious organ in German
literature. Pschorr simply reverses the experiment of Blake and Bell a sec­
ond time: the larynx as the transmitting organ replaces the ear, the re­
ceiving organ. And while Pschorr turns the handle, Goethe's recon­
structed corpse voices Goethe's verses. As if the "darkened chamber"
from which all " friends" are to flee were a grave known as the book.
So far, so good. Anatomical and technical reconstructions of lan­
guage do not belong to fiction as long as they remain within Pschorr's ex­
actly delineated boundaries: as the "repetition of a possibility, not of a re­
ality. " Immediately prior to Pschorr's reconstruction, Ferdinand de Saus­
sure had based a new linguistics on the difference between langue and
parole, language and speech, the possible combinations from a repository
of signs and factual utterances.104 Once it was clear how many phonemes
and what distinctive qualities made up Goethe's dialect, any conceivable
sentence (and not only the "Tame Xenium" chosen by Pschorr) could be
generated. That is all there is to the concept of langue.
Once Saussure's Cours de linguistique generale turned into a general
algorithm of speech analysis and production, microprocessors could ex­
tract the phonemic repository of speakers from their speeches without
having to fear, as did the media-technological heroes of yore, the blood
and poison of corpses. A Turing machine no longer needs artificial flesh.
The analog signal is simply digitized, processed through a recursive digi­
tal filter, and its autocorrelation coefficients calculated and electronically
stored. An analysis that continues Pschorr's band-pass filtering with more
advanced means. A second step may involve all kinds of linguistic syn-76
Gramophone
theses-once again the "repetition of a possibility" that computing logic
has extracted from language. Instead of lungs and vocal chords we have
two digital oscillators, a noise generator for unvoiced consonants and a
controlled frequency generator for vowels or voiced sounds. Just as in hu­
man speech, a binary decision determines which of the two oscillators
connects with the recursive filter. In turn, the autocorrelation coefficients
derived from the speech analyses are by way of linear prediction directed
towards the filters, an electronic simulation of the oral and nasopharyn­
geal cavity with all its echoes and running times. Now we only need a
simple low-pass filter to translate the signal flow back into analog sig­
nals 1 05-and we are all as "strangely moved " or "deceived" by the arriv­
ing phoneme sequences as Anna Pomke.
But Pschorr wants more. In order to fulfill the desire of timid middle­
class girls in its "entirety, " he attempts an "actual replay of words actu­
ally spoken by Goethe. " As if, half a century before Foucault, it were a
matter of discourse analysis. As is known, The Archaeology of Knowl­
edge is based on the Saussurian notion of language as "a finite body of
rules that authorizes an infinite number of performances." "The field of
discursive events, on the other hand, is a grouping that is always finite
and limited at any moment to the linguistic sequences that have been for­
mulated. " lo6 Statements, then, "necessarily obey" a "materiality" that
"defines possibilities of reinscription and transcription," lo7 as in Pschorr's
real repetition.
But how discourse repetition exactly is to be achieved remains ( at
least in Pschorr's case) a professional secret. For once, Hofrat Boffel's
skeptical inquiry, why "of all speeches we were able to listen to this one,"
is justified. After all, the air is full of sound waves caused by decades of
Goethean speechifying. Citing Pschorr, another of Friedlaender's heroes
claims that " all the waves of all bygone events are still oscillating in
space. " 108 Pschorr's phonograph is confronted with a parallel data input
that it would first have to convert into a serial arrangement, lest the sum
of all Goethean discourses appear as so much white noise on the cylinder.
Stochastic signal analyses such as linear prediction or autocorrelation
measurement may enable a technologically enhanced future to assign a
time axis even to past events, provided that signal processors have been
programmed with certain parameters concerning the language, vocabu­
lary, conversation topics, and so forth, of the object under investigation.
The chip production of not-von Neumann machines has begun. But no
machine in I9 I6 could have "adhered so closely" to real time as to haveGramophone
77
captured Goethe's words in the exact sequence in which they were spo­
ken in the course of one particular evening.
Which merely serves to show that all this electronic discourse proves
the obvious: Friedlaender fabricated Goethe's phonographed speech.
Mynona, the most nameless of authors, outdoes the most illustrious au­
thor by putting new words into his mouth. According to Goethe, litera­
ture was a "fragment of fragments, " because "the least of what had hap­
pened and of what had been spoken was written down, " and " of what
had been written down, only the smallest fraction was preserved. " Ac­
cording to Friedlaender, literature in the media age is potentially every­
thing. His hero could supplement all the conversations Eckermann al­
legedly "withheld from us. "
Especially a chapter from the Theory of Colors that (in spite of a
common contempt for Newton) has more to do with Friedlaender than
with Goethe. Friedlaender borrowed the Ubermensch notion that "one's
own will," united with the "magical sun-will," can " overpower fate "
from his teacher Dr. Marcus, who in turn borrowed it from Kant. "We
are at the dawn of the magic of reason; it will make a machine of nature
itself, " lo9 proclaims Dr. Sucram, the hero of Friedlaender's cinema novel
and whose name is a palindrome of Marcus, while turning Goethe's the­
ory of color into Gray Magic, that is to say, the world into film.
At the same time that technology (to quote Sucram's antagonist, the
film producer Morvitius) finally "moves from magic to machine,"llo phi­
losophy becomes delirious. Machines are supposed to turn back into
magic. Pschorr and Sucram are inspired by a technified version of Kant's
pure forms of intuition. "All that happens falls into accidental, uninten­
tional receivers. It is stored, photographed, and phonographed by nature
itself. " United with the spatial and temporal forms of intuition, "these ac­
cidental receivers only need to be turned into intentional ones in order to
visualize -especially cinematographically, Morvitius-the entire past. " 1 1 1
Loyally and deliriously, Friedlaender's philosophy follows in the
wake of media technology. On May I9, I900, Otto Wiener delivered his
highly appropriate inaugural lecture on "the extension of our senses" by
instruments. As with Friedlaender, his point of departure was the recog­
nition that "in principle it would not be difficult to take stock of our en­
tire knowledge by using self-recording machines and other automatic de­
vices, thus creating a physical museum of automata . " This museum
would even be able to inform extraterrestrial intelligence of "the level of
our knowledge. " In conclusion, however, Wiener declared that the "Kan-78
Gramophone
tian notions of the a priori nature of the perception of time and space are
unnecessary. " 1 1 2 Media render Man, "that sublime culprit in the most
serenely spiritual sense" of his philosophy, superfluous.
Which is why Friedlaender has Goethe's philosophical journey com­
mence with "hissing, hemming, and squeezing," only to end in "snoring."
It may not be as random and mathematical as the "perfectly even and un­
informative hiss" into which Turing's vocoder turned the radio speech of
his commander in chief, but Goethe's "actually recorded" voice, too, be­
longs to the real. The fictional elevated phallus shrivels up. And once
Pschorr has train wheels " defeat his victorious rival, Goethe's larynx,"
the engineer has finally beaten the author.
"The new phonograph, " Edison told the staff of Scientific American in
1 8 87, "is to be used for taking dictation, for taking testimony in court,
for reporting speeches, for the reproduction of vocal music, for teaching
languages," as well as "for correspondence, for civil and military orders"
and for "the distribution of the songs of great singers, sermons and
speeches, the words of great men and women. " 1 1 3 Which is why since
1 8 8 7 those great men and women have been able to do without body
snatchers like Pschorr.
To secure the worldwide distribution of these possibilities, Edison
sent representatives into all the countries of the Old World. In England,
the "willing victims " who "immortalized their voices in wax" included
Prime Minister Gladstone, an Edison admirer of long standing, and the
poets Tennyson and Browning. In Germany, Edison recruited Bismarck
and Brahms, who by recording one of his Hungarian rhapsodies removed
it from the whimsy of future conductors. l l4 The young emperor Wilhelm
II, however, did more than merely provide his voice. He inquired about all
the machine's technical details, had it disassembled in his presence, then
pushed aside Edison's representative and took it on himself to conduct the
assembly and presentation in the presence of an astonished court.ns The
military command-to freely paraphrase Edison- entered the age of
technology.
And it was only after the heroic action of their emperor-who for
reasons obviously related to naval strategy had studied radio telephony, 1 1 6
founded the Telefunken company, and in what almost amounted to mili­
tary prophecy prompted the construction of the AVUS as the first high­
way117-that Germany's writers paid attention to the alphabetless trace.
In 1 897, the foreign office legation council and Wilhelmine state poet
Ernst von Wildenbruch may have been the first to record a cylinder.Gramophone
79
Wildenbruch wrote a poem expressly for the occasion, "For the Phono­
graphic Recording of His Voice." The history of its transmission says it
all: it is not collected in the Collected Works. Professor Walter Bruch,
who as chief engineer of AEG-Telefunken and inventor of the PAL televi­
sion system had access to the archives of historical recordings, had to
transcribe Wilden bruch's verses from the roll. They are quoted here in a
format that will horrify poets, compositors, and literary scholars.
Das Antlitz des Menschen hRt sich gestalten, sein Auge im Bilde fest sich
halten, die Stimme nur, die im Hauch entsteht, die korperlose vergeht
und verweht.
Das Antlitz kann schmeichelnd das Auge betriigen, der Klang der Stimme
kann nicht betriigen, darum erscheint mir der Phonograph als der Seele
wahrhafter Photograph,
Der das Verborgne zutage bringt und das Vergangne zu reden zwingt.
Vernehmt denn aus dem Klang von diesem Spruch die Seele von Ernst
von Wildenbruch.
We may model the human visage, and hold the eye fast in an image, but the
bodiless voice, borne by air, must fade away and disappear.
The fawning face can deceive the eye, the sound of the voice can never lie;
thus it seems to me the phonograph is the soul's true photograph,
Which brings to light what is suppressed and makes the past speak at our
behest. So listen to the sound of what I declare, and Ernst von Wilden­
bruch's soul will be laid bare.u8
Even the copious writer Wildenbruch did not always rhyme so poorly.
His phonographic verses sound as if they had been improvised in front of
the bell-mouth without the benefit of any written draft. For the first time
since time immemorial, when minstrels combined their formulaic or
memorized words into entire epics, bards were in demand again. Which is
why Wildenbruch was bereft of written language.
Poetry, the last philosopher and first media theorist Nietzsche wrote,
is, like literature, in general simply a mnemotechnology. In 1 8 8 2, The
Gay Science remarked under the heading "On the Origin of Poetry " :
I n those ancient times i n which poetry came into existence, the aim was utility,
and actually a very great utility. When one lets rhythm permeate speech-the
rhythmic force that reorders all the atoms of the sentence, bids one choose one's
words with care, and gives one's thoughts a new colour, making them darker,
stranger, and more remote-the utility in question was superstitious. Rhythm was
meant to impress the gods more deeply with a human petition, for it was noticed
that men remember a verse much better than ordinary speech. It was also believed80
Gramophone
that a rhythmic tick-tock was audible over greater distances; a rhythmical prayer
was supposed to get closer to the ears of the gods.119
At the origin of poetry, with its beats, rhythms (and, in modern European
languages, rhymes), were technological problems and a solution that
came about under oral conditions. Unrecognized by all philosophical aes­
thetics, the storage capacity of memory was to be increased and the sig­
nal-to-noise ratio of channels improved. (Humans are so forgetful and
gods so hard of hearing.) The fact that verses could be written down
hardly changed this necessity. Texts stored by the medium of the book
were still supposed to find their way back to the ears and hearts of their
recipients in order to attain (not unlike the way Freud or Anna Pomke
had envisioned it) the indestructibility of a desire.
These necessities are obliterated by the possibility of technological
sound storage. It suddenly becomes superfluous to employ a rhythmical
tick-tock (as in Greece) or rhyme (as in Europe) to endow words with a
duration beyond their evanescence. Edison's talking machine stores the
most disordered sentence atoms and its cylinders transport them over the
greatest distances. The poet Charles Cros may have immortalized the in­
vention of his phonograph, precisely because he was never able to build
it, in lyrical rhymes under the proud title "Inscription"-Wildenbruch,
that plain consumer, is in a different position. "For the Phonographic
Recording of His Voice" no longer requires any poetic means. Rather
than dying and fading away, his voice reaches one of today's engineers.
Technology triumphs over mnemotechnology. And the death bell tolls for
poetry, which for so long had been the love of so many.
Under these circumstances writers are left with few options. They
can, like Mallarme or Stefan George, exorcise the imaginary voices from
between the lines and inaugurate a cult of and for letter fetishists, in
which case poetry becomes a form of typographically optimized black­
ness on exorbitantly expensive white paper: un coup de des or a throw of
the dice.120 Or for marketing reasons they can move from imaginary
voices, such as those Anna Pomke had hallucinated in Goethe's verses, to
real ones, in which case a poetry of nameless songwriters appears, or
reappears, on records. Illiterates in particular are their prime consumers,
because what under oral conditions required at least some kind of
mnemotechnology is now fully automatized. "The more complicated the
technology, the simpler," that is, the more forgetful, "we can live." 121
Records turn and turn until phonographic inscriptions inscribe themselves
into brain physiology. We all know hits and rock songs by heart precisely
because there is no reason to memorize them anymore.Gramophone
8 I
To provide a demographically exact account of White-Collar Work­
ers, including their nocturnal activities, Siegfried Kracauer becomes ac­
quainted with a typist, "for whom it is characteristic that she cannot hear
a piece of music in a dance hall or a suburban cafe without chirping along
its text. But it is not as if she knows all the hits; rather, the hits know her,
they catch up with her, killing her softly. " 122
Only two years or steps separate this sociology "from the newest
Germany" from fictional heroes such as those in Irmgard Keun's Rayon
Girl of 193 2, who (obviously under the influence of Kracauer) turn into
poets (and in Berlin into prostitutes) when listening to the gramophone or
the radio. For it is not the typewriter, in front of which the rayon em­
ployee Doris spends her days, that turns an entertainment consumer into
a producer. Only when she and her current lover hear "music from the ra­
dio" and listen to "Vienna, My One and Only" does she "feel like a poet"
who "can also rhyme, . . . if only up to a point. " 123 And if "a gramo­
phone next door" should be playing in the moonlight, "something won­
derful takes hold of her " : listening to a hit, Doris first of all has the feel­
ing "of making a poem" and then decides to write an autobiography or
even a novel.
I think it is good when I describe everything, because I am an uncommon person.
I am not thinking of a diary-that would be ridiculous for an up-to-date girl of
eighteen. But I want to write like a movie, because that's the way my life is and it
will soon be more so . . . . And when I read it later, it will be like a movie -I will
see myself in images.124
Entertainment novels (including Keun's) describe their own medial con­
ditions of production with great precision. The medium of the gramo­
phone has as its effect a type of poetry that is nothing but the inside of its
outside. Skipping all textuality it jumps straight into the medium of film.
My heart is a gramophone, playing excitedly with a sharp needle in my breast . . . .
From the movies comes music, records that are passing on human voices. And all
are singing . . . 125
Novels that flow from hits in order to end in movies are part of the "lit­
erature of nonreaders" reviewed in 19 26 by, of all j ournals, Die liter­
arische Welt:
This, the literature of nonreaders, is the most widely read literature in the world.
Its history has not yet been written. Nor do I feel quite up to the task myself. I
would simply like to make reference to one of its branches: poetry. For the litera­
ture of nonreaders, like " our" own, has a special category for poetry.82
Gramophone
Every couple of weeks there is a survey: " Who is the most beloved poet of
the year ? " Every time, the question is answered incorrectly. The ones we know
are not even considered. Neither Rilke nor Casar Flaischlen, not Goethe, and not
Gottfried Benn. Rather, Fritz Griinbaum ( " When You Can't, Let Me Do It! " ),
Schanzer and Welisch ( " If You See My Aunt " ) , Beda ( " Yes, We Have No Ba­
nanas" ) , Dr. Robert Katscher ( "Madonna, You Are More Beautiful than the Sun­
shine) "-and who else? A lot more -before Flaischlen, Rilke and Benn come up.
"The 222 Newest Hits"-that is the most popular poetry anthology of all.
The contents are revised and expanded every two months. And the whole thing
costs just ten cents. Here there is only one genuine type of poem: the love poem.
Girls, women, females-other topics are not favored.1 26
Even if all the names on both sides of the debate have long since
changed, this remains a very exact appraisal. With the invention of tech­
nical sound storage, the effects that poetry had on its audience migrate to
the new lyrics of hit parades and charts. Their texts would rather be
anonymous than deprived of royalties, their recipients illiterate rather
than deprived of love. At the same time, however, media technology's pre­
cise differentiation brings about a modern poetry that can do without all
supplementary sensualities ranging from song to love because-accord­
ing to a remark of Oscar Wilde's as ironic as it is appropriate-it is not
read. 127 And this remains the case even when Rilke plans poetic coronal
suture phonography or Benn writes poems that consciously set themselves
apart from the entertainment industry. For Benn's poems can merely note
but not verify that records and movies are part of a present that outpaces
our cultural critics. Otherwise, his poems would be as successful, anony­
mous, and forgotten as the hits they sing about:
A popular hit is more 1950
than five hundred pages of cultural crisis.
At the movies, to which you can take along hat and coat,
there is more firewater than in the cothurnus
and without the annoying intermission.128
Lowbrow and highbrow culture, professional technology and profes­
sional poetry: the founding age of modern media left us with those two
options. Wildenbruch's third way was eliminated. "So listen to the sound
of what I declare, and Ernst von Wildenbruch's soul will be laid bare,"
the imperial state poet rhymed, as if one could simultaneously speak into
technological machines and claim an immortal name. From sound back
to poem, from poem back to soul-that is the impossible desire to reduce
the real (the physiology of a voice) to the symbolic, and the symbolicGramophone
83
(an articulated speech) to the imaginary. The wheel o f media technology
cannot be turned back to retrieve the soul, the imaginary of all Classic­
Romantic poetry. What effectively remains of Wildenbruch in "For the
Phonographic Recording of His Voice" is nothing but noise, posthumous
already during his lifetime. Record grooves dig the grave of the author.
Wildenbruch pulls out all the stops of the imaginary and the symbolic, of
his immortal soul and his aristocratic name, so as not to have to speak of
his speaking body. " By virtue of our bodies," Paul Zumthor's theory of
oral poetry states, "we are time and place: the voice, itself an emanation
of our physicality, does not cease to proclaim it. " 1 29 Upon replaying the
old cylinder of r 897, it is a corpse that speaks.
Between or before lowbrow and highbrow culture, between hit records
and experimental poetry, there is only one third party: science. When
Wildenbruch spoke into the bell-mouth, the phonograph stored indices
rather than poems. And these indices speak precisely to the extent that
their sender cannot manipulate them. The poet performing "The Phono­
graphic Recording of His Voice" seemed at least to have been aware of
this: because "the sound of the voice can never lie," its technological stor­
age reveals the "hidden" and makes the "past"-the corpse of a Wilden­
bruch or a Goethe -speak.
Edison saw his phonograph "pressed into the detective service and
used as an unimpeachable witness" 130 in court. With technological media,
a knowledge assumes power that is no longer satisfied with the individ­
ual universals of its subjects, their self-images and self-representations­
these imaginary formations-but instead registers distinguishing particu­
lars. As Carlo Ginzburg has shown in " Clues and Scientific Method," this
new knowledge rules Morelli, Freud, and Sherlock Holmes, that is, aes­
thetics, psychoanalysis, and criminology. However, Ginzburg fails to see
that the shift in technologies of power simply follows the switch from
writing to media. Books had been able to store and convey the imaginary
corporeal self-images entertained by individuals. But unconsciously
treacherous signs like fingerprints, pitch, and foot tracks fall into the
purview of media without which they could neither be stored nor evalu­
ated. Francis Galton's dactyloscope and Edison's phonograph are con­
temporaneous allies.
Wildenbruch appears to have suspected as much, or else his verses
would not refer to the phonograph as the soul's own true photograph. His
paranoia is justified. A phonographically recorded state poet no longer
enters a pantheon of immortal writers but rather one of the countless84

evidence-gathering agencies that since 1 8 80 have been controlling our so­
called social behavior, that is, all the data and signs that are by necessity
beyond our control. The good old days in which a self-controlled and
"flattering" face could " fool" eyes equally bereft of media are over.
Rather, all the sciences of trace detection confirm Freud's statement that
"no mortal can keep a secret" because " betrayal oozes out of him atGramophone
85
every pore. " 1 31 And because (we may add) since 1 8 80, there has been a
storage medium for each kind of betrayal. Otherwise there would be no
unconsclOUS.
In 1908, the psychologist William Stern publishes a "Summary of De­
position Psychology. " This new science is designed to cleanse the oral de­
positions of court protocols, medical reports, personal files, and school re­
ports from all guile and deceit on the part of the speakers. Old European,
that is to say, literary, means of power are not immune from deception.
Whether for criminals or for the insane, the traditional "stylized deposi­
tions often produce a false impression of the examination and obscure the
psychological significance of individual statements. " As each answer "is,
from the point of view of experimental psychology, a reaction to the op­
erative stimulus in the question, "132 experimenters and investigators pro­
voke countermeasures in their subjects as long as they use the bureau­
cratic medium of writing. An argument made by the stimulus-response
psychologist Stern that, sixty years later, is reiterated by interaction psy­
chologists like Watzlawick ( despite all criticism of the stimulus-response
scheme) .133 Which is why examiners of 1908 recommend "the use of the
phonograph as an ideal method" 134 and those of 19 69 recommend tape
decks.135
In 190 5 , the Viennese psychiatrist Erwin Stransky, quietly anticipat­
ing his colleague Stern, published a study, On Speech Disturbances. In or­
der to contribute to the knowledge of such disturbances among the "men­
tally ill and mentally healthy, " German psychiatry for the first time
availed itself of the ideal method of phonography. Stransky had his sub­
jects "look and speak directly into the black tube" for one minute (the
recording time for one roll) after " all extraneous sense stimuli, " that is,
all the psychological problems of deposition, had been eliminated.136
Whatever they said was completely irrelevant. The " aim" of the whole
experiment "consists in shutting out all general concepts. " 137 To test
"concepts like 'speaking at odds,' 'hodgepodge,' 'thinking out loud,' 'hal­
lucination,' etc.," 138 the subjects had to abandon their so-called thinking.
In Stransky's phonographic experiment, "language, " in its "relative au­
tonomy from the psyche," 139 takes the place of general concepts or signi­
fieds, as if intending to prepare or facilitate a key concept of modern
literature.
Media technology could not proceed in a more exact fashion. Thanks
to the phonograph, science is for the first time in possession of a machine
that records noises regardless of so-called meaning. Written protocols
were always unintentional selections of meaning. The phonograph, how-86
Gramophone
ever, draws out those speech disturbances that concern psychiatry. Stran­
sky's fine statement that "the formation of general concepts " could be in­
hibited "for pathological or experimental reasons" 140 is a euphemism.
The "or" should be replaced by an equal sign. All the more so because the
splendidly consistent Stransky places in front of the machine not only psy­
chiatric patients but also, to collect comparative data, his own colleagues,
the doctors. For the latter, the ensuing hodgepodge was related to exper­
imental reasons, needless to say, while the patients had their pathological
reasons. But the fact that psychiatrists, too, immediately produce a whole
lot of nonsense when speaking into a phonograph, thereby relinquishing
the professional status that distinguishes them from madmen, fully
demonstrates the machine's power. Mechanization relieves people of their
memories and permits a linguistic hodgepodge hitherto stifled by the. mo­
nopoly of writing. The rules governing rhyme and meter that Wilden­
bruch employs to arrange his words when speaking into the phonograph;
the general concepts that Stransky's colleagues use to arrange theirs dur­
ing the first test runs-Edison's invention renders them all historically ob­
solete. The epoch of nonsense, our epoch, can begin.
This nonsense is always already the unconscious. Everything that
speakers, because they are speaking, cannot also think flows into record­
ing devices whose storage capacity is only surpassed by their indifference.
"The point could be made"-a certain Walter Baade remarked in 19 1 3 in
"On the Recording of Self-Observations by Dictaphone"-
that such an exertion is unnecessary, because it is not a matter of recording all re­
marks but only the important ones-this, however, fails to realize first of all that
utterances of great importance are often made by subjects in moments when they
themselves believe only to have made a casual remark and the examiner is alto­
gether unprepared for an important comment, and secondly that even when both
parties are aware that at least some part of a remark is " important," the decision
what should and should not be recorded by the protocol is frequently very diffi­
cult and, subsequently, has a disturbing effect. For the most part, these two afore­
mentioned reasons make the uninterrupted, indiscriminate recording of all utter­
ances appear as an idea[.141
Presumably the first to follow this ideal is a fictional psychiatrist of
1 897. Bram Stoker's Dracula, that perennially misjudged heroic epic of
the final victory of technological media over the blood-sucking despots
of old Europe,142 features a certain Dr. Seward, who is baffled by the non­
sensical discourse produced by his schizophrenic patient Renfield. The
latter keeps screaming that the master is approaching, but Dr. Seward
has no way of knowing that this refers to Dracula's arrival in England.Gramophone
87
However, in the wake of a profane illumination anticipating Dr. Stran­
sky, Dr. Seward resorts to media technology. He purchases one of the re­
cently mass-produced phonographs, not to record the patient ( as Stran­
sky did) but rather his own associations triggered by the latter's speeches.
The grooves store, to quote Seward's succinct and precise description, an
" unconscious cerebration" that divines the subconscious of the schizo­
phrenic but cannot advance all the way to the psychiatrist's ego. It is only
(as Baade put it) the uninterrupted, indiscriminate recording of all utter­
ances or associations that will allow Dr. Seward's unconscious cerebra­
tion "to give the wall to [its 1 conscious brother. " 143 And only the typed
transcription of all cylinders, recommended as early as 1 890 by Dr. Blod­
gett, 144 by a certain Mina Harker will reveal to him and all the others
hunting Dracula that the Count himself was behind Renfield's schizo­
phrenic nonsense.
Since 1 897, the year of Dracula's publication, this procedure has no
longer belonged to the realm of fiction. A science has emerged that turns
it and all its particulars into a method: psychoanalysis.
As is known, Freud's "talking cure" is based on a segmentation of
speech. On the one hand, patients lying on the couch speak-at least
that's what they believe -according to classic discourse rules: A Kantian
ego has to be able to accompany all my representations and provide for
correct words and sentences-sentences that, unfortunately, say nothing
about the patient. On the other hand, many minor symptoms emerge in
the flow of speech-interruptions and paralalia, nonsensical words and
puns-in which (to paraphrase Stransky) for pathological or experimen­
tal reasons the formation of general concepts has not occurred and a sub­
conscious appears. Subsequently, the attentive doctor need only separate
nonsense from sense like wheat from chaff (and not the other way
around). He feeds the parapraxes back to the patient, thus triggering new
associations and parapraxes, which once again are fed back, and so on
until an ego in control of speech has been dethroned and the unspeakable
truth can be heard.
Around 1900, only media theoreticians play as revolutionary a part
as the physician Freud. Experimenting with telephones and phonographs,
Hermann Gutzmann, a lecturer in speech disorders in Berlin, discovers
that the prompting of nonsense words to his patients produces nothing
but parapraxes. Precisely because both machines-due to transmission
economy or technical imperfections-limit the frequency band of lan­
guage on either end, what subjects " understand" can differ from what88
Gramophone
they "hear." Gutzmann speaks nonsense syllables like "bage" or "zoses"
into the mouthpiece, and the ear at the other end receives " lady" or
"process. " 145 A simple question brings to light an unconscious. And the
research in " On Hearing and Understanding" is able to "answer the ques­
tion what such experiments may mean for experimental psychology" :
First of all, it is evident that using fake words stimulates the combinatory powers
to such a degree that even against his will the listener is forced to replace the non­
sense syllables he has heard with those words closest in his mind, in the pertinent
constellation of ideas; that is, he is forced to hear the latter in the former. This can
be seen very clearly in the protocol of Subject I, a fickle eighteen-year-old who is
deeply in love; he is attracted to everything feminine, and the many girls' names
and an additional "lady" make his constellation of ideas easily recognizable. This
also applies to the fake French words of the two "well-educated young ladies. " If
we wanted to conduct phonographic tests aimed at discovering certain suspected
trains of thought, we would only need to use syllables sounding like the corre­
sponding words as stimuli in order to arrive at the positive or negative result.J46
Freud turns Gutzmann's simple suggestion into his explicit goal and
imaginary constellations into the subconscious. In other words, he him­
self takes the place of phonographic tests. And for good reason: the psy­
choanalyst in his chair would also be faced with the problem of repress­
ing or filtering the communication of an alien subconscious with his own
subconscious had he not from the very beginning turned his ears into a
technical apparatus. Unlike Gutzmann's subjects, Freud's patients fall
from sense into nonsense, yet their doctor is not allowed to use his un­
derstanding to turn it back into sense. For that reason, Freud's " Recom­
mendations to Physicians Practising Psycho-Analysis" simply amount to
telephony:
Just as the patient must relate everything that his self-observation can detect, and
keep back all the logical and affective objections that seek to induce him to make
a selection from among them, so the doctor must put himself in a position to make
use of everything he is told for the purposes of interpretation . . . without substi­
tuting a censorship of his own for the selection that the patient has foregone. To
put it in a formula, he must turn his own unconscious like a receptive organ
towards the transmitting unconscious of the patient. He must adjust himself to
the patient as a telephone receiver is adjusted to the transmitting microphone. Just
as the receiver converts back into sound waves the electric oscillations in the
telephone line which were set up by sound waves, so the doctor's unconscious is
able, from the derivatives of the unconsciousness which are communicated to
him, to reconstruct that unconscious, which has determined the patient's free
associations.147Gramophone
89
The fictional Dr. Seward had been obliged to first record his uncon­
scious associations, which traced those of another unconscious, before he
was able to arrive at a conscious interpretation upon replaying them. In
exactly the same way the historical Dr. Freud turns into a telephone re­
ceiver. Following the nationalization of the Vienna telephone exchange in
1 89 5 , he not only had a telephone installed in his study148 but also de­
scribed the work that went on in that study in terms of telephony. As if
"psychic apparatus, " Freud's fine neologism or supplement for the anti­
quated soul, were to be taken literally, the unconscious coincides with
electric oscillations. Only an apparatus like the telephone can transmit its
frequencies, because each encoding in the bureaucratic medium of writ­
ing would be subject to the filtering and censoring effects of a conscious­
ness. Under media conditions, however, " selection and refusal, " to quote
Rilke, are no longer permissible.149 Which is why the conscientious depo­
sition psychologist Freud abstains from note-taking during his sessions;
instead-and much like Dr. Seward listening to his cylinders-he pro­
duces them later. ISO
The question remains, however, how the telephone receiver Freud can
retain the communication from another unconscious. The phonograph
owners Drs. Seward, Stransky, and Gutzmann are not faced with this
problem, since they are in possession of a storage medium. Producing psy­
choanalytic case studies, that is, putting into writing what patients said,
requires that one record whatever the two censors on and behind the
couch want to render unsaid: parapraxes, puns, slips, signifier j okes. Only
technological media can record the nonsense that (with the one exception
of Freud) technological media alone were able to draw out into the open.
Freud's telephone analogy elides this point. Nonetheless, his principle that
consciousness and memory are mutually exclusive lSI formulates this very
media logic. For that reason, it is consistent to define psychoanalytic case
studies, in spite of their written format, as media technologies. Freud in­
troduces his "Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria" with the au­
dacious avowal that his written " record" of hysterical speeches has a
"high degree of trustworthiness, " though it is "not absolutely-phono­
graphically-exact. " l S2
Evidently, psychoanalysis competes with technological sound record­
ing. Its enemy or image is the phonograph, not film as Benjamin con­
cluded from global parallels.153 Neither as a word nor as a subject does
film occur in Freud's writings. Rather, psychoanalytic texts are haunted
by the absolute faithfulness of phonography. Thus, Freud's method of de­
tecting unconscious signifiers in oral discourse and then interpreting these90
Gramophone
signifiers as letters of a grand rebus or syllable puzzle154 appears as the fi­
nal attempt to establish writing under media conditions. Whereas women,
children, and madmen simply stop reading assigned novels and desert to
the movies as a "couch of the poor," 155 psychoanalysis once again teaches
them letters that, however, are signifiers devoid of all meaning and phan­
tasms. As a science it performs what Mallarme or George inaugurate as
modern literature.
In Berliner's own words, his Gramophone holds on to "the sound of
letters ";156 conversely, Freud's psychoanalysis holds on to the letters of
sound. While the entertainment industry transmits speech flows, the fac­
tual data input of every talking cure, and Freud's teacher Briicke, the an­
cestor of German speech physiology, analyzes them as such, Freud writes
down their signifiers. His justification: unlike any street urchin, he "could
not imitate " 157 all the stuttering, clicking of the tongue, gasping, and
groaning158 of his female hysterics. Which is why psychoanalysis is "not
absolutely-phonographically- exact"; and why "reality will always re­
main 'unknowable."' 159
A global success that falls short of the absolute or real has only one
precondition: patients, who, thanks to the telephonic and equidistant re­
ceptivity of Freud's' unconscious, may indulge in any kind of babble as
long as they stick to the everyday medium of orality, are themselves not
allowed to make use of storage technologies, lest they incur the wrath of
psychoanalysis, the discrete textual recording of contractually arranged
indiscretions.16o
Concerning "The Handling of Dream-Interpretation in Psycho­
Analysis, " its inventor notes that it would be a mistake to let patients
write down their own dreams. "For even if the text of a dream is in this
way laboriously rescued from oblivion, it is easy enough to convince one­
self that nothing thereby has been achieved for the patient. Associations
will not come to the text, and the result is the same as if the dream had
not been preserved. " 161 The storage medium of writing fails once it is uti­
lized by the patient and not by the analyst. Turning speech flows into syl­
lable puzzles or "letters, " which "do not occur in nature, " 162 remains the
monopoly of the scientist seated in his chair. Precisely because a dream
text already amounts to half an interpretation, it can no longer draw ideas
or speech flows out of the sick unconscious. As a result of this drainage,
writing assumes the transitoriness of orality; it is consumed by oblivion.
And thus psychoanalysis establishes with self-recursive elegance the
renown and status of its own text. In 193 2, Freud's writings receive the
Goethe prize.Schnell

" Should We Let Patients Write Down Their Own Dreams ? " Karl
Abraham asks in an essay of 19 1 3 that appears to confirm Freud's au­
thoritarian words with examples from the couch practice. "Against the
doctor's orders, " one of Abraham's patients "put writing materials next
to his bed" and, following a "a very extensive, eventful, and highly
charged dream, " brought "two quarto pages full of notes" to the session.
But to his own shame and to the delight of Abraham, he realizes "that the
notes are almost completely illegible. " 163 The psychoanalyst's love of non­
sensical speeches has no written or cryptographic equivalent. As is well
known, only printed works of literature, not illegible commonplaces, so­
licit interpretations.
But in spite of its title and its veneration of Freud, Abraham's essay
does not limit itself to the old medium of writing. What brought the es­
say to writing or to shock was something far more modern and " inge­
nious" : a phonograph in the hands of a patient.
Observation. 2d patient, who in response to his question was advised by me not
to write down dreams, produces a whole series of dreams in the following nights.
Upon awakening-in the middle of the night-he ingeniously tries to save from
oblivion the dreams he considers important. He owns an apparatus for recording
dictations and proceeds to speak the dreams into the bell-mouth. Characteristi­
cally, he forgets that for the last couple of days the machine has been malfunc­
tioning. As a result the dictation is difficult to understand. Patient is forced to fill
in a lot from memory. The dictation had to be complemented by the dreamer's
memory! The dream analysis proceeded without notable resistance, thus we can
assume that in this particular case the dream would have been retained even with­
out any recording.
The patient, however, was not convinced by this experience and instead
repeated the experiment one more time. Following a dream-filled night, the
machine, which in the meantime had been repaired, delivered a clearly audible
dictation. But according to the patient its content was so confused that he had dif­
ficulties enforcing some kind of order. As the succeeding nights furnished a
bounty of dreams which centered on the same complexes and could be repro­
duced without artificial aid, this case, too, proved the uselessness of immediate
recording. 164
In terms of deposition psychology, a patient who no longer writes down
but phonographically records his dreams is on the same level as his psy­
choanalyst. No writing material or filter interposes itself between the un­
conscious and its storage, no consciousness making the "selections" dis­
dained by Freud creates order. Reason enough to bring along the repaired
machine to the session and set it up next to the couch. Then the patientGramophone
93
would b e free to g o for a walk while his phonograph-to paraphrase
Kafka-could exchange dream-related information with the telephone re­
ceiver called a doctor. But no, preprogrammed by the analyst's instruc­
tions, Abraham's patient for once reverses the judgment that deposition
psychology had passed on phonography, its ideal method: audible to the
ear and to the unconscious, but confused and useless when it comes to con­
tent and level of consciousness. Thus is the historic opportunity missed to
test, during Freud's lifetime and without artificial aid, what distinguishes
absolute-phonographic-faithfulness from medical reproduction.
The test did not take place until 1969, when Edison's awkward ma­
chine was replaced by mass-produced magnetophones. Jean-Paul Sartre
received (and published) an anonymous tape with an enclosed letter that
suggests that the recording be entitled "Psychoanalytic Dialogue." 165 A.,
a 3 3 -year-old patient in a lunatic asylum, smuggled a tape recorder into
his last session and recorded everything: associations, interpretations, and
ultimately the terror of the doctor upon discovering the machine:
Dr. X. Help! Murder! Helllp! Helllp!
A. Shut up and sit down.
Dr. X. Hellllllp ! (screams again)
A. You're afraid I'm going to cut off your weenie?
Dr. X. Helllllllp! (That's the most beautiful scream of them all.)
A. That's a funny recordingP66
Indeed. For the first time a machine in the patient'S hands has replaced
case studies, that is, essays from the doctors' hands. A "large part" of the
conversation may be lost "due to the noise of the recording," 167 but in the
end are recorded all those data that Freud, orally or on paper, was unable
to imitate. Subject to neither selection nor refusal, a speech flow-that of
the psychoanalyst himself-is perpetuated as pure voice physiology.
As a result of which-according to the editor, Sartre-"the analyst
now becomes an object" and "the encounter of man with man is
thwarted once again." (From an existentialist perspective, psychoanalysis
was itself already a form of alienation.)168
Writers faced with media and philosophers faced with technology are
blind. As if so-called face-to-face communication could do without rules
or interfaces, storage or channels, Man once again has to see to it that in­
formation systems are ignored. What Sartre calls the second alienation is94
Gramophone
simply the demolition of a monopoly. In the patient's hands, the tape
recorder advances on a notation technique that could never be " ab­
solutely-phonographically-exact" and therefore once more reenacts
Old Europe under technologically advanced conditions: on the one hand,
patients, who unlike bygone illiterates can read and write but are not al­
lowed to; on the other, highly professional writers, who guard and mo­
nopolize their archives as if universal literacy or even media technology
were some pie in the sky. According to Foucault, "the political credit of
psychoanalysis" rested on the fact that it set "the system of law, the sym­
bolic order, and sovereignty" against the unrestricted "extension and in­
tensification of micro-powers"-powers not even Foucault revealed as
media technologies.169 This law, however, from Freud's "Mystic Writing­
Pad " to Lacan's "Insistence of the Letter in the Unconscious, " is writing
about writing, alphabetized monopoly squared. Only psychoanalysts
(they say) can write what does not cease not to write itself.
But the beat must go on. Technology and industry do not tolerate any de­
lay simply because a couple of writers or psychoanalysts stick to white
paper. From Edison's primitive phonograph cylinders all the way to pop­
ular music, the true poetry of the present, everything has gone like clock­
work. Berliner's gramophone record of 1 8 87, which no longer allowed
consumers to make their own recordings but which since 1 893 has al­
lowed producers infinite reproductions of a single metal matrix, became
the "prerequisite of the record mass market," 170 with a return that ex­
ceeded the 100 million dollar mark before the advent of radio.l7l The
mass-produced sound storage medium only needed mass-produced com­
munication and recording media to gain global ascendancy. Far removed
from old notions of sovereignty, all the powers of this and only of this
century strive to reduce the "population's leadership vacuum" l72 (to
quote a German media expert of 1939) to zero.
Broadcasting of weightless material came about for the purpose of
the mass transmission of records: in 192 1 in the United States, in 19 22 in
Great Britain, and in 19 23 in the German Reich. "The uniting of radio
with phonograph that constitutes the average radio program yields a very
special pattern quite superior in power to the combination of radio and
telegraph press that yields our news and weather programs. " 173 Whereas
Morse signs are much too discrete and binary to be a symbolic code for
radio waves, the continuous low frequencies of records are ideal for the
amplitude and frequency modulations known as broadcasting.
In 1903 a principal switch for transmitting such records was devel-Gramophone
95
oped by Professor Slaby of the Berlin Technical University, whose Voyages
of Discovery into the Electric Ocean delighted "His Imperial Majesty's
dinner table at tranquil Hubertusstock. "174 The same Imperial Maj esty
put Slaby's assistant Count von Arco in charge of Telefunken GmbH.
Building on Valdemar Poulsen's procedure, the two Berliners were able to
produce a high frequency whose wireless oscillations "were no longer in
the range of audibility but delighted the electrician as much as the thrice­
accented C of a famous tenor would a music lover. " 175 On this radio car­
rier frequency, "Caruso's singing, though emanating from the bell-mouth
of a gramophone, could be transmitted in all its purity to our ears through
the roaring metropolis " ; 176 that is, all the way from Sakrow to Pots­
dam.177 Slaby's choice of tenors was not coincidental: on March 1 8 , 1902,
Caruso had revamped his immortality-from the hearsay of future opera
audiences to gramophony.
Slaby and Arco, however, were conducting their research in the ser­
vice of the emperor and his navy. But soon civilians, too, came to enjoy
electrically transmitted records. A recording of Handel's Messiah is said
to have been part of the first actual radio broadcast, hosted by Reginald
A. Fessenden of the University of Pennsylvania on Christmas Eve,
1906.178 Long before the St. Petersburg revolutionaries, Brant Rock,
Massachusetts, had started its broadcast with " CQ, CQ-to all, to all"­
but only wireless operators on ships179 were able to receive the call and
the Christmas record.
A world war, the first of its kind, had to break out to facilitate the
switch from Poulsen's arc transmission to Lieben or De Forest's tube-type
technology and the mass production of Fessenden's experimental proce­
dure. It was not only in Germany, where the signal corps created in 19 I I
went to war with 5 5 0 officers and 5 ,800 men but returned with 4,83 I of­
ficers and 1 8 5 ,000 men,180 that the development of amplifier tubes was
given the highest priority. 181 Fighter planes and submarines, the two new
weapons systems, required wireless communications, just as military
command required vacuum tube technology for the control of high and
low frequencies. Tanks, however, which were equally in need of commu­
nications, kept losing their antennas in the barbed wire of the trenches
and for the time being had to make do with carrier pigeons.182
But the exponentially growing radio troops were also in need of en­
tertainment, because apart from machine-gun skirmishes and drumfire of­
fensives, trench warfare is nothing but sensory deprivation-or Combat
as Inner Experience, as JUnger so succinctly put it.183 After three years in
the wasteland between Flanders and the Ardennes, the military staffs-96

they were in possession of "army radio equipment. " Beginning in May

the first undersecretary for the national German radio network, was able
to "use a primitive tube transmitter to broadcast a radio program con­
sisting of records and the reading of newspaper articles. The project,
however, was canceled when a superior command post got wind of it and
prohibited the 'abuse of army equipment' for any future broadcast of mu­
sic or words ! " 185
But that's the way it goes. The entertainment industry is, in any con-Gramophone
97
ceivable sense of the word, a n abuse o f army equipment. When Karlheinz
Stockhausen was mixing his first electronic composition, Kontakte, in the
Cologne studio of the Westdeutscher Rundfunk between February 1958
and fall 1959, the pulse generator, indicating amplifier, band-pass filter, as
well as the sine and square wave oscillators were made up of discarded
u.s. Army equipment: an abuse that produced a distinctive sound. A
decade later, when the Cologne studio had at its disposal professionally
developed audio electronic equipment and the record industry demanded
that Kontakte attain hi-fi stereo quality, Stockhausen attempted in vain to
reproduce the sound: as an echo of a world war it could not do without
the abuse of military equipment.
And what is true microcosmically is also true macrocosmically. In
November 19 1 8, the 190,000 radio operators of the imperial German
army were demobilized but kept their equipment. Supported or super­
vised by the executives of the USPD (Independent Socialist Party), the in­
spectorate of the technical division of the signal corps (Itenacht) founded
a Central Broadcasting Bureau ( ZFL), which on November 25 was
granted a broadcasting license by the executive committee of the workers
and soldiers council.186 A "radio specter" that could have nipped the
Weimar Republic in the technological bud triggered the immediate
"counterattack" by Dr. Bredow.187 For the simple purpose of avoiding the
anarchistic abuse of military radio equipment, Germany received its en­
tertainment radio network. Records that hitherto had been used to liven
up military communication in the trenches of the Ardennes now came
into their own. Otherwise people themselves, rather than the government
and the media industry, could have made politics. In December 19 2 3 , two
months after the first Berlin broadcast, Postal Minister Dr. Hi::ifle, a mem­
ber of the centrist party, listed ( in order of increasing importance) the
three tasks of the "Entertainment Broadcasting Network" :
1.
Wireless music, lectures etc. are to provide the general public with quality
entertainment and education.
2. It is to be a new and important source of national revenue.
3 . The new installations are to provide a convenient means for the nation and
the states to convey whenever necessary official information to the public at
large; the latter may be of importance with regard to state security.
In the interest of state security it is necessary to ensure that only those citi­
zens own and operate equipment who have secured an official license to operate
radio stations, and that, in addition, owners of radio equipment only record
that which is intended for them.lss98
Gramophone
But what is intended for consumers is determined not only by state secu­
rity but also by technology. " Even at the risk of losing to radio all they
have earned with their records," 1 89 the record industry had to submit to
the standards of the new medium. Struggle in the Ether was the fitting
name of Arnolt Bronnen's novel dealing with the establishment of the ra­
dio networks and the music industry-a novel that cunningly puts the de­
sires of postal ministers into the mouths of the people and in particular
into that of a Berlin typist: " 'Records, gramophones, money,' she smiled,
lost in a dream, 'if one could sit here without records, gramophones,
money but still hear music . . . ' '' 190
In order to fulfill these wishes, the major arms and communications
technology corporations had to get rid of the old shellac craft. Pioneering
tinkerers like Edison and Berliner left the stage. The vacuum-tube ampli­
fier proceeded from high to low frequencies, from radio to records. In
I924, Bell Labs developed electromagnetic cutting amplifiers for recording
and an electromagnetic pickup for replaying and thereby delivered sound
recordings from the mechanical scratching of Edison's needle. In the same
year, Siemens presented the recording studios of the media conglomerates
with equally electric ribbon microphones, as a result of which grooves
were finally able to store frequencies ranging from roo bass hertz to 5 kilo­
hertz overtones, thus rising to the level of medium-wave transmitters.
Edison's prototype had for good reasons preferred human voices to .
orchestras. Only with electrical sound processing are records ready for
Hbfle's "wireless music." "At last," the Sunday Times wrote, mistaking
frequency bandwidth for sensuality, " an orchestra really sounds like an
orchestra; we get from these records what we rarely had before-the
physical delight of passionate music in the concert room or opera house.
We do not merely hear the melodies going this, that, or the other way in
a sort of limbo of tonal abstraction; they come to us with the sensuous ex­
citement of actuality. " 191
And actuality itself can be produced once composers are up to date.
For the third movement of Pini di Roma, Respighi wrote or rather de­
manded the recorded voice of a nightingale played against the backdrop
of composed-out string arpeggios. Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's fictional Edi­
son had already surrounded his woman of the future with metallic birds
of paradise, who " by using the Microphone" make "an immense volume
of sound" with their songs.192 But only Bell Labs nightingales were capa­
ble of outplaying entire symphonic orchestras. Thus, Arturo Toscanini
was able to premiere Respighi's sound poem as a media link combining
an orchestral score with phonographic kilohertz sensuality.193Gramophone
99
And the band played on. In the same year, 1924, U.s. researchers hit
upon the idea of applying to sound processing the technique of producing
intermediate frequencies. Thanks to frequency reduction, bat voices out­
side of the range of human audibility were caught on record. At least that
is what was reported by newspapers in Prague; the same Prague in which
a story was written immediately afterward entitled "Josefine the Singer,
or The Mouse Folk." "Is Josefine's art singing at all ? " Kafka's mice ask.
Is it not perhaps just a piping? And piping is something we all know about, it
is the real accomplishment of our people, or rather no mere accomplishment,
but a characteristic expression of our life. We all pipe, but of course no one
dreams of making out that our piping is an art, we pipe without noticing it, and
there are even many among us who are quite unaware that piping is one of our
characteristics.194
"The universe of sound," Cocteau's radio theory concludes, "has
been enriched by that of ultrasound, which is still unknown . . . . We shall
know that fish shout, that the sea is full of noises and that the void is peo­
pled with realistic ghosts in whose eyes we are the same." 195
In order to locate Cocteau's submarine ghosts, a world war, the sec­
ond one, had to break out. Today realism is in any event strategic. An un­
paralleled surge of innovations that from 1939 on filled land, sea, and air
with noise finally provided us (beyond Bell Labs) with records whose fre­
quency range approached both limits of the audibility range; that is, with
high fidelity. In 1940, four years before consumers were also able to pur­
chase "FFRR" (full frequency range recording) records and seven years
before Ansermet's hi-fi Petrouchka helped drive up annual record pro­
duction to four hundred million, the Decca Record Company succeeded
in capturing the ghostly noises on shellac. Quietly anticipating "Yellow
Submarine" and the sound quality of the Beatles,
the RAF Coastal Command had approached the English-owned Decca Record
Company with a secret and difficult assignment. Coastal Command wanted a
training record to illustrate differences between the sounds of German and British
submarines. Such aural distinctions were extremely delicate, and to reproduce
them accurately on a record called for a decided enlargement of the phonograph's
capabilities. Intensive work under the supervision of Decca's chief engineer,
Arthur Haddy, led to new recording techniques and the kind of record Coastal
Command desired.l96
But the enemy was not left standing behind. German record compa­
nies participated in the Battle of the Bulge. To avoid Allied suspicions
when the chief of Army Communications ordered a sudden radio silence1 00
Gramophone
for all areas of troop concentration south of the Cologne-Aachen line on
November, 1 2, 1944, the enemy had to be fed simulated attack prepara­
tions at other parts of the front. The Army High Command's propaganda
division developed special recordings for army loudspeakers, "which,
among other things, simulated: tank noises, marching troops, departing
and arriving trucks, the unloading of equipment, etc." 197
The whole spectrum of sound from infra- to ultrasound is, as was the
case with Kafka's mice, not art but an expression of life. It finally allows
modern detection to locate submarines wherever they may be, or tank
brigades where they are not. The great musicologist Hornbostel had al­
ready spent the First World War at the front : sound location devices with
huge bell-mouths and superhuman audibility ranges were supposed to en­
able ears to detect enemy artillery positions even at a distance of 30 kilo­
meters. Ever since, human ears have no longer been a whim of nature but
a weapon, as well as (with the usual commercial delay) a source of
money. Long before the headphone adventures of rock'n'roll or original
radio plays, Heinkel and Messerschmitt pilots entered the new age of
soundspace. The Battle of Britain, Goring's futile attempt to bomb the
island into submission in preparation for Operation Sea Lion, began with
a trick for guiding weapon systems: radio beams allowed Luftwaffe
bombers to reach their destinations without having to depend on daylight
or the absence of fog. Radio beams emitted from the coast facing Britain,
for example from Amsterdam and Cherbourg, formed the sides of an
ethereal triangle the apex of which was located precisely above the tar­
geted city. The right transmitter beamed a continuous series of Morse
dashes into the pilot's right headphone, while the left transmitter beamed
an equally continuous series of Morse dots-always exactly in between
the dashes-into the left headphone. As a result, any deviation from the
assigned course resulted in the most beautiful ping-pong stereophony (of
the type that appeared on the first pop records but has since been dis­
carded). And once the Heinkels were exactly above London or Coventry,
then and only then did the two signal streams emanating from either side
of the headphone, dashes from the right and dots from the left, merge into
one continuous note, which the perception apparatus could not but locate
within the very center of the brain. A hypnotic command that had the pi­
lot-or rather, the center of his brain-dispose of his payload. Histori­
cally, he had become the first consumer of a headphone stereophony that
today controls us all-from the circling of helicopters or Hendrix's Elec­
tric Ladyland all the way to the simulated pseudo-monophony, in theGramophone

The difficulty British intelligence had in countering stereophonic re­
mote control is explained by its chief technical officer, Professor Reginald
Jones. Because the Luftwaffe's radio beam transmitters operated in fre­
quency ranges even beyond VHF, which in 1940 the Secret Service was in­
capable of receiving and of which it had no conception, help could only102

come from a profane illumination. An incident occurred on the Farnbor­
ough airfield while testing a loudspeaker system attached to a fuselage,
which, just as in today's Pentagon project, was designed to blast rebel­
lious natives in northwestern India with divine voices. When the officer
standing in front of the microphone heard his voice coming from the dis­
tant loudspeaker two seconds later, he laughed about this acoustic delay.
His laughter, in turn, was returned as another echo until the feedback af­
fected all the participants and Farnborough resounded with a noise simi­
lar to that heard when rock musicians lean their guitars against the speak­
ers. A "system that laughed by itself, " Jones called it. But instead of
laughing along, he chose to understand: Feedback, the principle of all os­
cillators, can also generate centimetric wave frequencies, something the
experts refused to believe.199 Jones ordered the construction of synchro­
nized receivers, which, in turn, located the Luftwaffe's radio beam trans-Gramophone

mitters and their targets. The Battle of Britain was won. (Even if the war­
lord Churchill, not wanting to reveal to the enemy that his secrets had
been revealed, disallowed the evacuation of Coventry, which had already
been identified as a target city. )
Survivors and those born later, however, are allowed to inhabit
stereophonic environments that have popularized and commercialized the
trigonometry of air battles. Ever since EMI introduced stereo records in
I95 7,200 people caught between speakers or headphones have been as con­
trollable as bomber pilots. The submarine location duties of aspiring air
force officers or the bombing target locations of Heinkel pilots turn into
hypnosis, which in Stoker's I 89 7 Dracula still had to be used to solve,
without the help of radio technology, a very strategic submarine detection
problem.201 But in I9 66, following two world wars and surges in innova­
tion, hypnosis and recording technology finally coincide: engine noises,
hissing steam, and a brass band move across the walls from left to right
and back while a British voice sings of the literal chain that linked Liver­
pool's submarine crews to postwar rock groups.
In the town where I was born
lived a man who sailed to sea

The Beatles simply transported everybody to that impossible space that
once concealed Count Dracula in his black coffin in the black belly of his
ship, floating in the Black Sea until he was located, and subsequently de­
stroyed, by hypnotic sound detection. Hi-fi stereophony can simulate any
acoustic space, from the real space inside a submarine to the psychedelic
space inside the brain itself. And should locating that space either fail or
be a ruse designed to fool the consumer, it is only because the supervising
sound engineer has proceeded as shrewdly as the disinformation cam­
paign prior to the Battle of the Bulge.1 04
Gramophone
Once again, these deceptions were programmed by the admirable
Villiers de l'Isle-Adam. By design or accident, his Edison places " his
hand on the central control panel of the laboratory," whereupon the tele­
phonic voice of his agent in New York " seemed to come from all the cor­
ners of the room at once. " A dozen speakers scattered across the labora­
tory-obviously modeled on the first soundspace experiments conducted
between the Paris Opera and the Palace of Industry in 1 8 8 1-make it
possible.203
With the help of stereo recordings and stereo, VHF acoustic decep­
tions can invade operas completely. When, in 1959, John Culshaw pro­
duced Solti's beautifully overmodulated Rhinegold, the homelessness of
spirits was implemented. Of course the other gods and goddesses, male
and female singers, were each assigned their own space between the
stereo channels. But Wagner's great technician Alberich, upon tearing the
newly completed Tarnhelm out of his brother Mime's hands and demon­
strating in hands-on fashion the advantages of invisibility, appears to be
coming, like Edison's telegrapher, from all corners at once. "Thus, in
scene III, Alberich puts on the Tarnhelm, disappears, and then thrashes
the unfortunate Mime. Most stage productions make Alberich sing
through a megaphone at this point, the effect of which is often less dom­
inating than that of Alberich in reality. Instead of this, we have tried to
convey, for thirty-two bars, the terrifying, inescapable presence of Al­
berich: left, right, or centre there is no escape for Mime. "204
Culshaw's stereo magic simply puts into practice what the great me­
dia technician Wagner had in mind for his dramatic doppelganger.
"Everywhere now he lies in wait," sings Alberich, lost in acoustic space,
making those he keeps " under guard" " subject to him forever. " 205 In
other words, Wagner invented the radio play, as Nietzsche immediately
realized: "His art always carries him in two directions, out of a world of
auditory drama into a mysteriously kindred world of visual drama, and
vice versa."206 The Ring of the Nibelung, that zero series of all word
wars, could just as well be called Struggle in the Ether.Gramophone
105
To broadcast the ethereal struggle, radio merely had to take over the
innovations of the world wars and, in a move that reversed the one fol­
lowing the First World War, adapt itself to the standard of records. Be­
cause amplitude modulation did not leave enough frequency range, the
old AM radio would have been unable to transmit hi-fi songs or stereo ra­
dio plays.
The spectacular growth of FM is attributable to its technical superiority to AM,
and relative cheapness as an investment medium. In the late fifties, it was found
that the great range of FM channels could not only sustain a higher fidelity for
single transmissions, but could in fact also be used to broadcast separate signals
simultaneously in a process called "multiplexing. " This discovery made possible
stereo musical broadcast. Stereo broadcast was particularly attractive to those au­
diences discriminating and wealthy enough to prefer high fidelity music . . . . As
the rock audience grew in size and sophistication, it came to demand the same
sound quality which it could get from records at home (reflected in the tremen­
dous increase in the middle and late sixties in the stereo component market), but
could not get from AM radio. 207
Frequency modulation and signal multiplexing, the two components
of VHF, are of course not a U.S. commercial discovery of the 195 0S.
Without "his ingenious technical decision" in favor of signal multiplex­
ing, General Fellgiebel, chief of Army Communications, would not have
been able to control the invasion of Russia, that is, "the most immense
task ever faced by any signal corps in the world. "208 Without Colonel
Gimmler of Army Ordnance and his refutation of the delusion "that very
high frequencies (between 10m and 1 m) propagate in a straight line and
are therefore of no use in the battle field, "209 Colonel General Guderian,
the strategist of the tank blitzkrieg, would have been forced to resort to
World-War-I-era carrier pigeons. Instead, his armored wedges, " from the
tanks in the most forward position back to divisional, corps, and army
command," were, unlike his enemies, equipped with VHF.21 O "The engine
is the soul of the tank," Guderian used to say, " and radio, " General
Nehring added, "its number one. " Then as now VHF radio reduces the
leadership vacuum to zero.
On September I I , 1944, American tank vanguards liberated the city of
Luxembourg and its radio station. Radio Luxembourg returned to its pre­
war status as the largest commercial broadcaster and advertiser of
records on a continent of postal, telegraphic, and radio state monopo­
lies.211 But four years as an army station had left its traces: traces of a new
way of storing traces.I06

Basic diagram of Poulsen's telegraphone.
By the early 1940S, German technicians had made some startling advances. Radio
monitors who listened to the German broadcasting stations day after day for
British and United States intelligence soon realized that many of the programs
they were hearing could not possibly derive from live studio broadcasts. Yet there
were a fidelity and a continuity of sound, plus an absence of surface scratching, in
the German transmissions that ordinary transcription records could never have
yielded. The mystery was solved . . . when the Allies captured Radio Luxem­
bourg . . . and discovered among the station's equipment a new Magnetophone of
extraordinary capabilities. 212
It was not until I940 that technicians at BA5F and AEG had by
chance hit upon the technique of radio frequency premagnetizing, thus
turning Valdemar Poulsen's experimental telegraphone of I 898 into an
operational audiotape with a IO kilohertz frequency bandwidth. Up until
then, the record-radio media link had operated as a one-way street.
Transmitters and gramophone users replayed what Berliner's master disc
had once and for all recorded, even if radio stations-in a late vindica­
tion of Edison-made use of special phonographs developed for the spe­
cific purpose of program storage. 21 3 But under combat conditions those
wax cylinders, which, since I930, were allowed to record parliamentary
sessions strictly for " archival purposes," were useless.2 1 4 A propaganda
ministry that turned radio into "the cultural 55 of the Third Reich" 21 5
needed a recording and storage medium as modern and mobile as Gude­
rian's tank divisions.
Major General von Wedel, chief of Army Propaganda, recounts:
We were also essentially dependent on developments of the propaganda ministry
with regard to radio equipment for war correspondents. That also applied to theGramophone
1 07
appropriate vehicles. When it came to tank divisions, the Luftwaffe, or parts of
the navy, the opportunities for original combat recordings were hampered by the
fact that we could not obtain the stable and horizontal supports necessary for pro­
ducing discs. At first, we were forced to make do with belated dispatches.
A significant change occurred after the Magnetophone was invented and
thoroughly designed for the purpose of war reports. Original combat reports from
the air, the moving armored vehicle, or the submarine, etc., now became impres­
sive firsthand accounts. 216
As Ludendorff had pointed out, it is a truth of Total War that "the
mass usage of technological equipment can be tested much better in
wartime than would ever be possible in peace." 21 7 The motorized and mo­
bilized audiotape finally delivered radio from disc storage; "Yellow Sub­
marine, " or "war as acoustic experience," became playable.
But reaching beyond the acoustic experiences of the so-called general
public, the magnetic tape also revolutionized secret transmissions. Ac­
cording to Pynchon, " operators swear they can tell the individual send­
ing-hands . " 218 As a consequence, the Abwehr [German Counterintelli­
gence Service] , as part of the German Army High Command, had the
" handwriting" of every single agent recorded at the Wohldorf radio sta­
tion close to Hamburg before they went abroad on their secret missions.
Only magnetic tapes guaranteed to Canaris and his men that it "was re­
ally their agent sitting at the other end and not an enemy operator. "219
Inspired by this success, the Abwehr switched from defense to of­
fense. Because the enemy was not yet in possession of magnetic tapes, the
Abwehr was in a position to transmit its famous Funkspiele (radio
games), which in spite of their name resulted not in the entertainment of
millions in front of speakers but in the death of 50 British agents. The Ab­
wehr managed to capture and turn around agents who had parachuted
into the Netherlands. As if nothing had happened, they were forced to
continue their transmissions in their own handwriting. The transmission
of German Funkspiel messages to London (or, in one parallel case, to
Moscow) lured additional agents into the Abwehr trap. Normally, intelli­
gence agencies arrange emergency signals with their agents for such situ­
ations, " such as using an old code, making absurd mistakes, or inserting
or omitting certain letters of punctuation. " 220 Each Morse message of the
converted agents was taped, analyzed, and, if need be, manipulated be­
fore it was transmitted. This procedure continued uninterrupted for years
in the hardly civilian ether.
The world-war audiotape inaugurated the musical-acoustic present.
Beyond storage and transmission, gramophone and radio, it created em-108
Gramophone
pires of simulation. In England, Turing himself considered using a cap­
tured German Magnetophone as the storage mechanism for his projected
large computer. Like the paper strip of the universal discrete machine,
tapes can execute any possible manipulation of data because they are
equipped with recording, reading, and erasing heads, as well as with for­
ward and reverse motion.221 Which is why early, cheap pes work with at­
tached tape decks.
In a far more practical vein, captured magnetic tapes aroused sleepy
U.S. electric and music giants who had, naturally, taken on duties other
than commercial ones between 1942 and 194 5 .222 Inserted into the signal
path, audiotapes modernized sound production; by replacing gramo­
phones they modernized sound distribution. Tape decks made music con­
sumers mobile, indeed automobile, as did the radio producers in the Mag­
netophone-equipped German lead tanks of old. Thus, the "American
mass market" was "opened up" by "the car playback system. " 223 To min­
imize the leadership vacuum and exploit the possibilities of stereophony,
the only things missing were new VHF stations with rock'n'roll and traf­
fic reports on the transmitting end and car radios with FM and decoders
on the receiving end. Six-cylinder engines whisper, but the stereo equip­
ment roars. Engine and radio are (to paraphrase Guderian and Nehring)
also the soul of our tourist divisions, which under so-called postwar con­
ditions rehearse or simulate the blitzkrieg.
The central command, however, has moved from general staffs to en­
gineers.224 Sound reproduction revolutionized by magnetic tape has ren­
dered orders unnecessary. Storing, erasing, sampling, fast-forwarding,
rewinding, editing-inserting tapes into the signal path leading from the
microphone to the master disc made manipulation itself possible. Ever
since the combat reports of Nazi radio, even live broadcasts have not
been live. The delay that in the case of tapes is due to separate head mon­
itoring (and that is now more elegantly achieved by digital shift regis­
ters) 225 suffices for so-called broadcast obscenity policing lines. It appears
that listeners, once they have been called by a disc j ockey and are on the
air, are prone to exhibit an unquenchable desire for obscenities. Today
everybody can and (according to Andy Warhol) wants to become famous,
if only for two minutes of airtime. In the blind time to which media, as
opposed to artists, are subject, chance is principally unpredictable. But
the 6.4 seconds of dead time the broadcast obscenity policing line inserts
between telephone call and actual broadcast make censorship (if not art)
possible in the data flow of the real.
That is precisely the function of audiotapes in sound processing. Edit-Gramophone
1 09
ing and interception control make the unmanipulable as manipulable as
symbolic chains had been in the arts. With projects and recourses, the
time of recurrence organizes pure random sequences; Berliner's primitive
recording technology turns into a Magical Mystery Tour. In 1954, Abbey
Road Studios, which not coincidentally produced the Beatles' sound, first
used stereo audiotapes; by 1970 eight-track machines had become the
standard; today discos utilize 3 2 or 64 tracks, each of which can be ma­
nipulated on its own and in unison.226 " Welcome to the machine, " Pink
Floyd sang, by which they meant, "tape for its own ends-a form of col­
lage using sound." 227 In the Funkspiele of the Abwehr, Morse hands
could be corrected; in today's studios, stars do not even have to be able to
sing anymore. When the voices of Waters and Gilmour were unable to hit
the high notes in " Welcome to the Machine," they simply resorted to time
axis manipulation: they dropped the tape down half a semitone while
recording and then dropped the line in on the track.228
But neither is tape technology always an end in itself, nor does editing
always amount to correction or beautification. If media are anthropolog­
ical a prioris, then humans cannot have invented language; rather, they
must have evolved as its pets, victims, or subjects. And the only weapon
to fight that may well be tape salad. Sense turns into nonsense, govern­
ment propaganda into the white noise of Turing's vocoder, impossible
fillers like is/or/the are edited out:229 precisely the ingredients of William
Burroughs's tape cut-up technique.
"Playback from Eden to Watergate" begins (like all books) with the
word, and in the beginning that word was with God. But not only in the
shape of speech, which animals, too, have at their command, but also as
writing, the storage and transmission of which made culture possible
in the first place. "Now a wise old rat may know a lot about traps and
poison but he cannot write 'Death Traps in Your Warehouse' for the
Reader's Digest."230 Such warnings, or " tactics," are restricted to hu­
mans-with the one exception that they were not capable of warning of
the warning system of writing, which subsequently turned into a deadly
trap. Because apes never mastered writing the "written word" mastered
them: a "killer virus" that "made the spoken word possible. The word
has not yet been recognized as a virus because it has achieved a state of
stable symbiosis with the host," which now seems to be " breaking
down." 231 Reconstructing the apes' inner throat, which was not designed
for speech, the virus created humans, especially white males, who were
stricken with the most malignant infection: they mistook the host itself for
its linguistic parasite. Most apes died from sexual frenzy or because the110
Gramophone
virus caused "death through strangulation and vertebral fracture." 232 But
with two or three survivors the word was able to launch a new beginning.
Let us start with three tape recorders in the Garden of Eden. Tape recorder one is
Adam. Tape recorder two is Eve. Tape recorder three is God, who deteriorated af­
ter Hiroshima into the Ugly American. Or, to return to our primeval scene: tape
recorder one is the male ape in a helpless sexual frenzy as the virus strangles him.
Tape recorder two is the cooing female ape who straddles him. Tape recorder
three is DEATH.2 33
What began as a media war has to end as a media war so as to close
the feedback loop linking Nixon's Watergate tapes to the Garden of Eden.
" Basically, there is only one game and that game is war. "234 World war
weapons like the Magnetophone have been put to commercial use in the
shape of tape recorders, as a result of which ex-writers like Burroughs can
take action. The classic rift between the production and reception of
books is replaced by a single military interception.235
We now have three tape recorders. So we will make a simple word virus. Let us
suppose that our target is a rival politician. On tape recorder one we will record
speeches and conversations, carefully editing in stammers, mispronunciations, in­
ept phrases-the worst number one we can assemble. Now, on tape recorder two
we will make a love tape by bugging his bedroom. We can potentiate this tape by
splicing it with a sexual object that is inadmissible or inaccessible or both, say,
the Senator's teenage daughter. On tape recorder three we will record hateful, dis­
approving voices. We'll splice the three recordings in together at very short inter­
vals and play them back to the Senator and his constituents. This cutting and
playback can be very complex, involving speech scramblers and batteries of tape
recorders, but the basic principle is simply splicing sex tape and disapproval tapes

As simple as any abuse of army equipment. One just has to know
what Shannon's and Turing's scrambler or the German Magnetophone
can be used for.237 If "control, " or, as engineers say, negative feedback, is
the key to power in this century,23 8 then fighting that power requires pos­
itive feedback. Create endless feedback loops until VHF or stereo, tape

duces wild oscillations of the Farnborough type. Play to the powers that

recording studios and FM transmitters, and uses tape montages to subvert
the writing-induced separation into composers and writers, arrangers and
interpreters. When Chaplin, Mary Pickford, D. W. Griffith, and others
founded United Artists following the First World War, a movie executive
announced that "the lunatics have taken charge of the asylum." The same
thing happened when Lennon, Hendrix, Barrett and others started
recording their Gesamtkunstwerke by making full use of the media inno­
vations of the Second World War.240
Funkspiel, VHF tank radio, vocoders, Magnetophones, submarine lo­
cation technologies, air war radio beams, etc., have released an abuse of
army equipment that adapts ears and reaction speeds to World War n+ I .
Radio, the first abuse, lead from World War I to II, rock music, the next
one, from II to III. Following a very practical piece of advice from Bur­
roughs's Electronic Revolution,241 Laurie Anderson's voice, distorted as
usual on Big Science by a vocoder, simulates the voice of a 747 pilot who
uses the plane's speaker system to suddenly interrupt the ongoing enter­
tainment program and inform passengers of an imminent crash landing
or some other calamity. Mass interception media like rock music amount
to mobilization, which makes them the exact opposite of Benjamin's dis­
traction.242 In 193 6, only the unique " Reichsautozug Deutschland, a mo­
torcade consisting of eighty vehicles," was able to " broadcast party con­
gresses and mass rallies without any local help by setting up speaker sys­
tems on a giant scale, erecting stands, and so on" : 243 today, the same is
achieved night after night by the trucks and kilowatt systems of any rock
group. Filled to the brim with electronics or army equipment, they carry
us away to Electric Ladyland. The theme of love, that production secret
of the literature for nonreaders, has run its course. Rock songs sing of the
very media power which sustains them.
Lennon and McCartney's stereo submarine is not the only postwar
lyric in the literal sense of the word. The Final Cut, Pink Floyd's last
record, was written by Roger Waters ( born 1944) for Eric Fletcher Wa­
ters ( 19 1 3-1944), that is, for a victim of a world war. It begins, even be­
fore the first sound, with tape cut-ups of news broadcasts (on the Falk­
lands, NATO fleet transporters, nuclear power stations), which all simply
serve to point out that " postwar, " both the word and the thing itself, is a
"dream," a distortion made to mollify consumer ears. "Post War Dream"
is followed by "The Hero's Return. " The cut-up returns to its origins:
when army communication equipment, the precursor of the mass me­
dium radio, cuts up the symbolic and the real, orders and corpses. A com­
memoration that is the flip side of postwar, love and Muzak.I I 2

Interception, chopping, feedback, and amplification of war reports:
"Sympathy for the Devil" means nothing else. Legend has it that the
Rolling Stones used cut-up techniques to produce the lyrics for Beggars
Banquet. They cut out newspaper headlines, pasted them to the studio
wall, and shot at them. Every hit was a line. Anticipating modern statis­
tics, the precondition of cut-up and signal processing in general, Novalis
remarked: "The individual facts are random events-the combination of
random events-their concurrence is itself not subject to chance, but to
laws-a result of the most profound systematic wisdom. " 245
Thus, the random distribution of newspaper headlines results in the
law of information technology and a martial history of rock music. The
devil, whose voice is immortalized by "Sympathy for the Devil," was
there when the revolutionaries of St. Petersburg killed the czar and, with
their radio transmission "CQ-to all," turned army equipment into
global AM radio; he was there when television broadcast both Kennedy
assassinations, turned "you and me" into murderers, and exorcised all ra­

cut-up techniques have done away with that virus. Before Hendrix, the
paratrooper of the IOI st Airborne, cuts his machine-gun-like guitar to the
title song, tape technology operates for its own sake: tympana, jet engines,
pistol shots. Writing can write nothing of that. The Songbook for Electric
Ladyland notes the tape's forward and backward motion as well as its
changing speed and the test points of a blind but manipulable time.247 The

Media cross one another in time, which is no longer history. The recording
of acoustic data was accomplished with sound tricks, montage, and cuts;
it is with film tricks, montage, and cuts that the recording of optical
processes began. Since its inception, cinema has been the manipulation of
optic nerves and their time. This is proved, among other ways, by the
now-prohibited trick of repeatedly splicing individual frames of a Coca­
Cola ad into feature films: because its flashlike appearance for 40 millisec­
onds reaches the eyes but not consciousness, the audience develops an in­
explicable yet irresistible thirst. A cut has undercut its conscious registra­
tion. The same is true of film. Beginning with Eastman in r 8 87, when
celluloid superseded Daguerre's photographic glass plates and provided
the material basis for feature films, such manipulations became feasible.
Cinema, in contrast to sound recording, began with reels, cuts, and splices.
It is said that the Lumiere brothers documented simply and inces­
santly what their lens could record and what the type of projection they
developed could reproduce. Legend has it, however, that Georges Melies,
the great film pioneer, ran out of celluloid while shooting a street scene.
He left the tripod and camera in position and loaded a new reel, but in
the meantime so-called life naturally went on. Viewing the fully spliced
film, its director was consequently surprised by the magical appearance
and disappearance of figures against a fixed background. Melies, who as
former director of the Theatre Robert Houdin had already projected
many a magical trick onto the technological screen,l had accidentally also
stumbled upon the stop trick. Hence in May r 89 6, " before the eyes of an
astonished and dumbfounded audience," he presented " L'Escamotement
d'une dame, the disappearance of a woman from the picture. " 2 Techno­
logical media (following Villiers and his Edison) liquidate that " great

Lady, Nature," as it had been described, but never viewed, by the nine­
teenth century. Woman's sacrifice.
And castration. For what film's first stop tricks did to women only re­
peated what the experimental precursors of cinema did to men. Since
1 87 8 Edward Muggeridge (who changed his name to Eadweard Muy­
bridge to commemorate old Saxon kings)3 had been experimenting with
twelve special cameras on behalf of the California railroad tycoon and
university founder, Leland Stanford. The location was Palo Alto, which
later saw the invention of the vacuum tube, and the assignment was the
recording of movements whose speed exceeded the perception of any
painter's eye. Racehorses and sprinters dashed past the individually and
sequentially positioned cameras, whose shutters were triggered succes­
sively by an electromagnetic device supplied by the San Francisco Tele­
graph Supply CompanY-1 millisecond for every 40 milliseconds.4
With such snapshots (literally speaking) Muybridge's handsome vol­
umes on Animal Locomotion were meant to instruct ignorant painters in
what motion looks like in real-time analysis. For his serial photographs
testified to the imaginary element in human perception, as in the positions
of horses' legs on canvas or on English watercolor paper. To speak of cin­
ema as Muybridge's historical goal would, however, be inaccurate, since
celluloid was not yet available. The technological medium was meant to
modernize a venerable art form, as indeed happened when impressionists
like Degas copied photographs in their paintings. Hence Stanford Univer­
sity's fencers, discus throwers, and wrestlers posed as future models forFilm
117
painters, that is, nude-at least as long as they turned their backs to one
of the twelve cameras. In all the milliseconds of frontal shots, however,
Muybridge reached one last time for the painter's brush in order to prac­
tice (long before Melies) the disappearance of the male anatomy with re­
touched gymnastic shorts.
Had they been copied onto celluloid and rolled onto a reel, Muy­
bridge's glass plates could have anticipated Edison's kinetoscope, the
peephole precursor to the Lumieres' cinematic projection. The astonished
visitors to the 1 893 World's Fair in Chicago would then have been witness
to the first trick film: the jumpy appearance and disappearance of moral
remains, which in the age of cinema approximate the condition of pure
image-flickering.
The trick film therefore has no datable origin. The medium's possi­
bilities for cutting and splicing assail its own historiography. Hugo Miin­
sterberg, the private lecturer at the University of Freiburg whom William
James called to the Harvard Psychological Laboratory, clearly recognized
this in 19 16 in the first history of cinema written by a professor:
It is arbitrary to say where the development of the moving pictures began and it is
impossible to foresee where it will lead. What invention marked the beginning?
Was it the first device to introduce movement into the pictures on a screen? Or did
the development begin with the first photographing of various phases of moving
objects? Or did it start with the first presentation of successive pictures at such a
speed that the impression of movement resulted? Or was the birthday of the new
art when the experimenters for the first time succeeded in projecting such rapidly
passing pictures on a wall? 5
Miinsterberg's questions remain unanswered because the making of
films is in principle nothing but cutting and splicing: the chopping up of
continuous motion, or history, before the lens. "Discourse," Foucault
wrote when he introduced such caesuras into historical methodology it­
self, "is snatched from the law of development and established in a dis­
continuous atemporality: . . . several eternities succeeding one another, a
play of fixed images disappearing in turn, do not constitute either move­
ment, time, or history. " 6 As if contemporary theories, such as discourse
analysis, were defined by the technological a priori of their media.
Methodological dreams flourish in this complication or implication.
Theory itself since Freud, Benjamin, and Adorno has attempted to
pseudo-metamorphose into film.7 It is also possible, however, to under­
stand technological a prioris in a technological sense. The fact that cuts
stood at the beginning of visual data processing but entered acoustic datarr8
Film
processing only at the end can then be seen as a fundamental difference
in terms of our sensory registration. That difference inaugurated the dis­
tinction between the imaginary and the real.
The phonograph permitted for the first time the recording of vibra­
tions that human ears could not count, human eyes could not see, and
writing hands could not catch up with. Edison's simple metal needle,
however, could keep up-simply because every sound, even the most
complex or polyphonous, one played simultaneously by a hundred musi­
cians, formed a single amplitude on the time axis. Put in the plain lan­
guage of general sign theory, acoustics is one-dimensional data processing
in the lower frequency range.8
The continuous undulations recorded by the gramophone and the au­
diotape as signatures of the real, or raw material, were thus passed on in
an equally continuous way by sound engineers. Cutting and splicing
would have produced nothing but crackling noises, namely, square-curve
jumps. Avoiding them presupposes great skill on the part of recording en­
gineers, if not the computer algorithms of digital signal processing.
Therefore, when pioneers of the radio play such as Breslau's Walter
Bischoff were looking for genuinely "radio-specific" (funkisch) means of
expression, they studied the parallel medium of silent films and consid­
ered only the fade-out, not the cut, as a possible model: "The man work­
ing the amplifier, " as Bischoff argued in Dramaturgy of the Radio Play,
"is in charge of a function similar to that of the camera man. He fades in
and out, as we say in the absence of a radio-specific terminology. By
slowly turning down the condenser at the amplifier, he lets the scene, the
finished sequence of events, fade into the background, just as he can, by
gradually turning the condenser up, give increasing form and shape to the
next acoustic sequence. " 9 By following such continuity, which is diamet­
rically opposed to the film cut, things worked well for thirty years. But
ever since VHF radio began transmitting stereophonically, that is, two
amplitudes per unit of time, fade-outs have been "more difficult to exe­
cute " : "the mise-en-scene, invisible yet localizable, cannot be dismantled
and replaced by a new one in front of the listener as easily as in the case
of a monophonic play. " lo Once tethered, such are the constraints pro­
duced by the real.
For one thing, optical data flows are two-dimensional; for another,
they consist of high frequencies. Not two but thousands of units of light
per unit of time must be transmitted in order to present the eye with a
two- or even three-dimensional image. That requires an exponential mag­
nification of processing capacities. And since light waves are electromag-Film
1 19
netic frequencies in the terahertz range, that is, a trillion times faster than
concert pitch (A), they outpace not only human writing hands but even
(unbelievably) today's electronics.
Two reasons why film is not directly linked to the real. Instead of
recording physical waves, generally speaking it only stores their chemical
effects on its negatives. Optical signal processing in real time remains a
thing of the future. And even if, following Rudolph Lothar's rather timely
metaphysics of the heart, everything from sound to light is a wave (or
hertz),ll optical waves still don't have a storage or computing medium­
not, at any rate, until fiber technologies running at the speed of light have
put today's semiconductors out of business.
A medium that is unable to trace the amplitudes of its input data is
permitted a priori to perform cuts. Otherwise, there would be no data.
Since Muybridge's experimental arrangement, all film sequences have
been scans, excerpts, selections. And every cinematic aesthetic has devel­
oped from the 24-frame-per-second shot, which was later standardized.
Stop trick and montage, slow motion and time lapse only translate tech­
nology into the desires of the audience. As phantasms of our deluded
eyes, cuts reproduce the continuities and regularities of motion. Phonog­
raphy and feature film correspond to one another as do the real and the
Imagmary.
But this imaginary realm had to be conquered. The path of invention,
from Muybridge's first serial photographs to Edison's kinetoscope and the
Lumiere brothers, does not merely presuppose the existence of celluloid.
In the age of organic life stories (as poetry) and organic world histories
(as philosophy), even in the age of mathematical continuity, caesuras first
had to be postulated. Aside from the material precondition, the spliceable
celluloid, there was a scientific one: the system of possible deceptions of
the eye had to be converted from a type of knowledge specific to illusion­
ists and magicians ( such as Houdini) to one shared by physiologists and
engineers. Just as the phonograph (Villiers de l'Isle-Adam notwithstand­
ing) became possible only after acoustics had been made an object of sci­
entific investigation, so "cinematography would never have been in­
vented " had not "researchers been occupied with the consequences of the
stroboscopic effect and afterimages. " 12
Afterimages, which are much more common and familiar than the
stroboscopic effect, were already present in Goethe's Theory of Colors­
but only, as in Wilhelm Meister's Years of Apprenticeship, to illustrate the
effects of Classic-Romantic literature on souls: a woman hovers in front1 20
Film
of the inner eye of the hero or the readers as the optical model of perfect
alphabetization, even though her beauty simply cannot be recorded in
words. Wilhelm Meister observes to himself and his like-minded readers,
"If you close your eyes, she will present herself to you; if you open them,
she will hover before' all objects like the manifestation which a dazzling
image leaves behind in the eye. Was not the quickly passing figure of the
Amazon ever present in your imagination? " 13 For Novalis, imagination
was the miraculous sense that could replace for readers all of their senses.
At least as long as Goethe and his Theory of Colors were alive. For it
was Fechner who first examined the afterimage effect with experimental
rigor. Experimenter and subject in one, he stared into the sun-with the
result that he went blind in 1 839 for three years and had to resign from
his physics chair at the University of Leipzig. The historical step from psy­
chology to psychophysics (Fechner's beautiful neologism) was as conse­
quential as the emergence of modern media from the physiological hand­
icaps of its researchers was literal.
No wonder, then, that the aesthetics of the afterimage effect is also
due to a half-blind person. Nietzsche, the philosopher with -14 diop­
ters, 14 produced a film theory before its time under the pretext of de­
scribing both The Birth of Tragedy in ancient Greece and its German re­
birth in the mass spectacles of Wagner. 15 In Nietzsche, the theater perfor­
mances that were produced in the shadeless midday sun of an Attic
setting were transformed into the hallucinations of inebriated or vision­
ary spectators, whose optic nerves quite unconsciously processed white­
and-black film negatives into black-and-white film positives: "After an en­
ergetic attempt to focus on the sun, we have, by way of remedy almost,
dark spots before our eyes when we turn away. Conversely, the luminous
images of the Sophoclean heroes-those Apollonian masks-are the nec­
essary productions of a deep look into the horror of nature; luminous
spots, as it were, designed to cure an eye hurt by the ghastly night. " 16
Prior to Fechner's historical self-experiment, blinding was not a mat­
ter of desire. An eye hurt by the ghastly night that requires for its remedy
inverted afterimage effects is no longer directed toward the stage of the
Attic amphitheater but onto the black surface of soon-to-come movie
screens, as the Lumiere brothers will develop them in defiance of their
name. Nietzsche's ghastly night is the first attempt to christen sensory de­
privation as the background to and other of all technological mediaY
That the flow of data takes place at all is the elementary fact of Nietz­
sche's aesthetic, which renders interpretations, reflections, and valuations
of individual beauty (and hence everything Apollonian) secondary. If "theFilm
121
world" can be "justified to all eternity . . . only as an aesthetic product, " 18
it is simply because "luminous images" obliterate a remorseless blackness.
The Nietzsche movie called Oedipus is technological enough to pre­
date the innovation of the Lumieres by a quarter century. According to
The Birth of Tragedy, a tragic hero, as inebriated spectators visually hal­
lucinate him, is "at bottom no more than a luminous shape projected onto
a dark wall, that is to say, appearance through and through. " 19 It is pre­
cisely this dark wall, which allows actors to turn into the imaginary, or
film stars, in the first place, that has been opening theater performances
since 1 876, the year of the inauguration of the theater in Bayreuth, whose
prophecy The Birth of Tragedy undertook. Wagner did what no drama­
turg before him had dared to do (simply because certain spectators in­
sisted on the feudal privilege of being as visible as the actors themselves ) :
during opening night, h e began The Ring of the Nibelung i n total dark­
ness, before gradually turning on the (as yet novel) gaslights. Not even the
presence of an emperor, Wilhelm I, prevented Wagner from reducing his
audience to an invisible mass sociology and the bodies of actors (such as
the Rhine maidens) to visual hallucinations or afterimages against the
background of darkness.2o The cut separating theater arts and media tech­
nologies could not be delineated more precisely. Which is why all movie
theaters, at the beginning of their screenings, reproduce Wagner's cosmic
sunrise emerging from primordial darkness. A 19 1 3 movie theater in
Mannheim, as we know from the first sociology of cinema, used the slo­
gan, " Come in, our movie theater is the darkest in the whole city ! "21
Already in 1 89 1 , four years prior to the projection screen of the Lu­
miere brothers, Bayreuth was technologically up to date. Not for nothing
did Wagner joke that he would have to complete his invention of an in­
visible orchestra by inventing invisible actors.22 Hence his son-in-law, the
subsequently notorious Chamberlain, planned the performance of sym­
phonies by Liszt that would have become pure feature films with equally
pure film music: accompanied by the sound of an orchestra sunk in Wag­
nerian fashion, and situated in a "nightclad room," a camera obscura was
supposed to project moving pictures against a " background " until all
spectators fell into "ecstasies. "23 Such enchantments were unthinkable
with old-fashioned viewing: eyes did not mix up statues or paintings, or
the bodies of actors, for that matter-those basic stage props of the es­
tablished arts-with their own retinal processes. Thanks only to Cham­
berlain's plans and their global dissemination by Hollywood, the physio­
logical theory of perception becomes applied perceptual practice: movie­
goers, following Edgar Morin's brilliant formulation, "respond to the1 22
Film
projection screen like a retina inverted to the outside that is remotely con­
nected to the brain. "24 And each image leaves an afterimage.
In order to implement the stroboscopic effect, the second theoretical
condition of cinema, with the same precision, one needs only to illumi­
nate moving objects with one of the light sources that have become om­
nipresent and omnipotent since the 1 890S. As is widely known, back then
Westinghouse won out over Edison, alternating current over direct cur­
rent, as a public utility. The glow of light alternates fifty times per second
in European lightbulbs, sixty times in American ones: the uncomplicated,
and hence imperceptible, rhythm of our evenings and of an antenna called
the body.
The stroboscopic illumination transforms the continuous flow of
movement into interferences, or moires, as can be seen in the wheeling
spokes of every Western. This second and imaginary continuity evolved
from discontinuity, a discovery that was first made by physiologists dur­
ing the founding age of modern media. We owe a large part of the theory
of alternating current to Faraday, as well as to the study On a Peculiar
Class of Optical Deceptions ( 1 83 I ).25 Coupled with the afterimage effect,
Faraday'S stroboscopic effect became the necessary and sufficient condi­
tion for the illusions of cinema. One only had to automatize the cutting
mechanism, cover the film reel with a wing disk between moments of ex­
posure and with a Maltese cross during moments of projection, and the
eye saw seamless motion rather than 24 single and still shots. One perfo­
rated rotating disk during the recording and projection of pictures made
possible the film trick preceding all film tricks.
Chopping or cutting in the real, fusion or flow in the imaginary-the
entire research history of cinema revolves only around this paradox. The
problem of undermining the threshold of audience perception through
Faraday's "deceptions " reflected the inverse problem of undermining the
threshold of perception of psychophysics itself to avoid disappointment or
reality. Because real motion (above and beyond optical illusions) was to
become recordable, the prehistory of the cinema began exactly as that of
the gramophone. Etienne-Jules Marey, professor of natural history at the
College de France in Paris, and later (following his successful film experi­
ments) president of the French photographic society,16 earned his initial
fame with a sphygmograph copied from the work of German physiologists
that was capable of recording pulse rates onto soot-covered glass plates as
curves.27 In the same way, Weber and Scott had mechanically stored
sounds (musical intervals themselves) that were not acoustic illusions.
Beginning with heart muscle contractions, Marey investigated move-Film

ment in general. His chronographic experiments on humans, animals,
birds-published as La machine anima Ie ( 1 8 7 3 ) , a title that does j ustice
to La Mettrie -inspired Governor Stanford of California to give Muy­
bridge his assignment. The professional photographer only had to replace
Marey's mechanized form of trace detection with a more appropriate, or
professional, optical one-and where eyes had always seen only poetic1 24
Film
wing-flaps could begin the analysis of the flight of birds, the precondition
for all future aircraft constructions. It was no coincidence that pioneers
of photography such as Nadar opted against the montgolfieres of 1 7 8 3
and i n favor of literal airships: for flying machines heavier than air.2s
"Cinema Isn't I See, It's I Fly, "29 says Virilio's War and Cinema, in view of
the historically perfect collusion of world wars, reconnaissance squad­
rons, and cinematography.
In the meantime, the first photographs from Animal Locomotion had
hardly appeared when Marey began work on improving Muybridge's im­
provement of his own work. The time was ripe for engineers to work to­
gether, for innovations of innovations. Marey also stored motion opti­
cally, but he reduced the number of cameras from the twelve of his pre­
decessor to one and constructed-first with fixed photo glass plates, and,
from 1 8 8 8 on, with modern celluloid30-the first serial-shot camera. In­
stead of indulging in what Pynchon called "the American vice of modular
repetition, "31 he realized that for moving objects, a single, movable appa­
ratus was enough. Its name-the chronophotographic gun-spoke noth­
ing but the real truth.
It was in 1 8 61, whilst traveling on a paddle-steamer and watching its wheel, that
the future Colonel Gatling hit upon the idea of a cylindrical, crank-driven ma­
chine gun. In 1 8 74 the Frenchman Jules Janssen took inspiration from the multi­
chambered Colt (patented in 1 83 2) to invent an astronomical revolving unit that
could take a series of photographs [when attached to a telescope]. On the basis of
this idea, Etienne-Jules Marey then perfected his chronophotographic rifle, which
allowed its user to aim at and photograph an object moving through space.3 2
The history of the movie camera thus coincides with the history of
automatic weapons. The transport of pictures only repeats the transport
of bullets. In order to focus on and fix obj ects moving through space, such
as people, there are two procedures: to shoot and to film. In the principle
of cinema resides mechanized death as it was invented in the nineteenth
century: the death no longer of one's immediate opponent but of serial
nonhumans. Colt's revolver aimed at hordes of Indians, Gatling's or
Maxim's machine-gun (at least that is what they had originally been de­
signed to do) at aboriginal peoples.33
With the chronophotographic gun, mechanized death was perfected:
its transmission coincided with its storage. What the machine gun anni­
hilated the camera made immortal. During the war in Vietnam, U.S. Ma­
rine Corps divisions were willing to engage in action and death only when
TV crews from ABC, CBS, and NBC were on location. Film is an immea-Film

surable expansion of the realms of the dead, during and even before bul­
lets hit their targets. A single machine-gun (according to JUnger's obser­
vation on Der Arbeiter) finishes off the fraternity-based heroism of entire
Langemarck regiments of 19 14;34 a single camera does the same with the
dying scenes thereafter.
It was then only a matter of combining the procedures of shooting
and filming to take Marey's brand name literally. The chronophotographic
gun became reality in the cinema of artificial, that is, lethal, bird flights.
Reconnaissance pilots of the First World War such as Richard Garros con­
structed an on-board machine-gun whose barrel was pointed parallel to
the axis of the propeller while they filmed its effects.35 During the Second
World War, which according to General von Fritsch was supposed to have
been won by superior reconnaissance, "the construction of recording de­
vices within aircraft yielded still better results. " Major General von Wedel,
chief of Army Propaganda, was "especially delighted that Inspector Tan­
nenberg was successful in having developed a camera unit that could be
built into fighter planes, Stukas, and other aircraft and that, synchronized
with the weapon, made possible very impressive combat pictures. "36

chon describes in Gravity's Rainbow "this strange connection between the
German mind and the rapid flashing of successive stills to counterfeit
movement, for at least two centuries-since Leibniz, in the process of in­
venting calculus, used the same approach to break up the trajectories of
cannonballs through the air. "38 That is how venerable (in strict accordance
with Munsterberg) the prehistory of cinema is. But it makes a difference
whether ballistic analysis appears on the paper of a mathematician or on
celluloid. Only freeze-frame photographs of flying projectiles, developed
in 1 8 8 5 by one no less than Ernst Mach, made visible all interferences, or
moin�s, in the medium of the air. Only freeze-frame photographs run au­
tomatically and as real-time analysis (since then, TV cameras have re­
duced the processing time of pictures to near-zero). Which is why Inspec­

with their teams of operators were ineffective against the Allied carpet
bombings of Germany, the first developments toward our strategic present
took place -the search by technicians for weapons systems with auto­
matic target searching.39 The chronophotograph was made for that.
Built into aircraft, TV cameras or infrared sensors are no longer the
owls of Minerva, lagging behind so-called real history like Hegel's nightly
philosophy. The kinds of infinitesimal movement they process through in­
tegration and differentiation are much more efficient: with servomotors
electrically linked to a missile guidance system, they can hone in on the
enemy target. Until camera and target, intercept missile and fighter air­
craft, explode in a flash of lightning, a blitz.
Today's cruise missiles proceed in the same fashion, for they compare
a built-in film of Europe's topography (from Hessia to Belarus, from Sicily
to Ukraine ) with their actual flight path in order to correct any possible
deviations. Marey's chronophotographic gun has reached its target in all
its senses. When a camera blows up two weapons systems simultaneously,
and more elegantly than kamikaze pilots did, the analysis and synthesis of
movement have become one.
At the end of Gravity's Rainbow, a V2-the first cruise missile in the
history of warfare, developed at the Peenemunde Army Test Site- ex­
plodes over the Orpheus movie theater in Los Angeles. In grandiose time
axis manipulation, which a fictitious drug by the name of Oneirine grants
the whole novel,40 the launch is correctly dated March 194 5 , but the
rocket does not hit its target until 1970, when the novel was written. That
is how interminably world wars go on, not least because of German­
American technological transfer. The off-ground detonator of the V21 28
Film
kicks in, and a ton of Amatol, the rocket's payload, explodes. Shortly
thereafter, the image on the screen dissolves, as if the projection bulb
were blowing out, but only so that its orphic truth can shine forth. We,
"old fans, who've always been at the movies," are finally reached by a
film "we have not learned to see "41 but have been hankering after since
Muybridge and Marey: the melding of cinema and war.
Nothing, therefore, prevented the weapons-system movie camera from
aiming at humans as well. On the three fronts of war, disease, and crimi­
nality-the maj or lines of combat of every invasion by media-serial pho­
tography entered into everyday life in order to bring about new bodies.
As is widely known, during the First World War the barrels of ma­
chine-guns moved away from the black, yellow, and red skins against
which they had been developed and started aiming at white targets.
Movie cameras, however, kept pace and experienced a boom that might
have been a misuse of army property (as with AM radio) . At any rate,
Miinsterberg, who had to know about it, since he sought to prevent the
outbreak of the German-American war in futile fireside chats with Presi­
dent Wilson up to the very end (and who, for that reason, remains unac­
knowledged by his colleagues at Harvard to this very day)42-Miinster­
berg wrote in 19 16:
It is claimed that the producers in America disliked these topical pictures because
the accidental character of the events makes the production irregular and inter­
feres too much with the steady preparation of the photoplays. Only when the war
broke out, the great wave of excitement swept away this apathy. The pictures
from the trenches, the marches of the troops, the life of the prisoners, the move­
ments of the leaders, the busy life behind the front, and the action of the big guns
absorbed the popular interest in every corner of the world. While the picturesque
old-time war reporter has almost disappeared, the moving picture man has inher­
ited all his courage, patience, sensationalism, and spirit of adventure.43
And as with the reporters, so with the stars of the new medium.
Shortly after the trench war, when the Soul of the Cinema was in demand
again, Dr. Walter Bloem, S.]., explained what was at the center of the sen­
sationalism critiqued by Miinsterberg: "During the war, film actors busily
studied the thousands of dead, the results of which we can now admire
on the screen. "44
Since April 19 1 7, the founding days of radio entertainment for army
radio operators as well, such studies had been resting on a solid founda­
tion. The chiefs of the new Army High Command, Hindenburg and Lu-Film
1 29
dendorff, were serious about total war, and for that reason (among oth­
ers) they advanced to the top of Germany's film directors. What evolved
in the Grand General Staff was a Bureau of Pictures and Film [BUFA;
Bild- und Filmamt] "whose founding and mode of operation was kept
rather secret. " Still, it is known that the bureau's "range of operations "
included " supplying the inland and the front with films, setting up field
movie theaters, the placement of war reporters, . . . censoring all films to
be imported and exported, as well as providing all censoring agencies
with instructions from the governing military censorship authorities . "45
The way Ludendorff justified these changes is more than just memo­
rable; it has made film history. A memo by the general quartermaster led
via the chain of command to the founding of the UFA. As a major corpo­
ration, UFA was to take over the classified assignments of the Bureau of
Pictures and Film in a much more public and efficient way-from the end
of the First World War until, as is widely known, the end of the Second:

The war has demonstrated the overwhelming power of images and films
as a form of reconnaissance and persuasion. Unfortunately, our enemies
have exploited their know-how in this area so thoroughly that we have
suffered severe damage. Even for the more distant continuation of the
war, film will not lose its significance as a political and military means
of influence. Precisely for that reason, for a successful conclusion to the
war it is absolutely imperative that film have a maximal effect in those
areas where German intervention is still possible.
signed Ludendorff46
Thus, film as a means of reconnaissance and persuasion has been ex­
plained, or reconnoitered, in the strictest (that is, military) sense of the term.
The path leads, as with radio, from interception to reception and
mass mediality. And Ludendorff donated 900 of his movie theaters at the
front to this reception, making it possible to decode Lieutenant ]Unger's
Combat as Inner Experience.
Positional warfare prohibits inner experience in Goethean terms, that
is, sensory substitutions between the lines of literature. In both his title
and his subject, Junger announces a very different type of sensuousness:
" When red life clashes against the black cliffs of death, what we get are
sharp pictures composed of bright colors . . . . There is no time to readI30
Film
one's Werther with teary eyes. "47 For media-technological reasons, poetry
comes to an end in the trenches, those "pure brainmills " : "This failure
even appears to be a matter of writing," says a fellow officer and friend
of Junger whose "intellectual faculties, in the daily rhythm between
watch duty and sleep, gradually dwindle toward zero." Which the troop
leader and recipient of the Ordre pour Ie Merite demonstrates and con­
firms with his telegram-style answer, "that this war is a chokehold on our
literature. "48
But ghosts, a.k.a. media, cannot die at all. Where one stops, another
somewhere begins. Literature dies not in the no-man's-land between the
trenches but in that of technological reproducibility. Again and again,
Lieutenant Junger asserts how completely the inner experience of the bat­
tle has become a matter of neurophysiology. After the "baptism by fire"
of I9 I4, soldiers had become "so cerebral that the landscape and the
events, in retrospect, managed to escape from memory only as dark and
dreamlike shadows. "49 Even more clearly, and in terms of radio: "Every
brain, from the simplest to the most complicated, vibrated with the waves
of the monstrous, which propagated itself over the landscape. "5o The war,
even though "it was so palpable, and rested heavily, like lead, on our
senses "-as when, for example, " an abandoned group traversed un­
known territory under the canopy of night" -was hence and simultane­
ously "perhaps only a phantasm of our brains. "51
Brain phantasms, however, "glowing visions"52 that "burden anxious
brains "53 like the trenches: they exist only as the correlatives to techno­
logical media. The soul becomes a neurophysiological apparatus only
when the end of literature draws near. Hence, the "screams from the
dark" that "touch the soul most immediately, . . . since all languages and
poets, by contrast, are only stammerings, " combine the "clamor of fight­
ers" with "the automatic play of the barrel-organ."54 And as with
acoustics, so with the optics of war: " Once again, one's individual expe­
rience, the individual, . . . was compressed, once again the colorful world
rolled like a swift film through the brain. "55
In the days of the founding age of modern media, the neurologist
Benedict described how the dying visualize their past as time-lapse pho­
tography. Lieutenant Junger could do this without pseudomorphosis. Af­
ter one of his "fourteen "56 war injuries, he was, for purposes of reconva­
lescence, relocated to Douchy, a village and communications site in Flan­
ders, "the headquarters of the 7 3 d [ light-infantry regiment] . "57 "There
was a reading room, a cafe, and later even a cinema in a large barn skill­
fully converted. "58Film
131
Only in Storm of Steel, his fact-based Diary of a German Storm­
Troop Officer, does JUnger speak of the BUFA and its work: "supplying
the inland and the front with films, setting up field movie theaters, " and
so on. In Combat as Inner Experience, this hymn to the trench worker, he
does not so much ignore media technology as translate its effects expres­
sionistically. Writing itself relocates in the projection room of Douchy.
That is why and why alone "the blossoms of the world, blinding and be­
numbing, cities on waters of light, southern coasts where blue waves
washed against the shore, women cast in satin, queens of boulevards, "
and the whole range of feature-film archives of inner experiences, " opened
themselves" up to the "wandering brains"59 of soldiers in the trenches,
even in their darkest moments of sensory deprivation.
One year before the outbreak of the war, Kurth Pinthus's Movie
Book announced: " One has to get used to the thought that kitsch will
never be eliminated from the world of humans. After we've been trying
for decades to get rid of kitsch in the theater, it resurfaces in cinema. And
one is led to believe that the masses have found the kitsch expelled from
the stage somewhere else. " 60
In a world war, for example: "All hearts pound with excitement
when the armies of soldiers line up for battle with desperately harsh
faces; when grenades burst, releasing a shower of smoke; and when the
camera relentlessly traverses the battlefield, ingesting the stiff and muti­
lated bodies of senselessly killed warriors. "61
A prophecy that Junger, the mythic war reporter, realizes or recog­
nizes. To recognize combat as an inner experience means (following Lu­
dendorff) understanding that the use of film "in those areas where Ger­
man intervention is still possible" is "absolutely imperative . . . for a suc­
cessful conclusion to the war. " For although historical prose suggests, as
is widely known, that the other side won, Junger's camera style drives for­
ward German attacks again and again, only to freeze the continuation of
history or the movies in a last still. In the final analysis, such a film trick
becomes possible simply because in mechanized warfare, machine-gun
operators kill without seeing any corpses,62 and storm troopers-Luden­
dorff's newly formed precursors to the blitzkrieg63-storm without seeing
into enemy trenches.
That is why the British, when their attack tears Junger out of his
filmic "castle in the air, " appear only "for one second . . . like a vision en­
graved . . . on my eyes. " 64 That is why the novel succeeds in letting its
end, its goal and wish fulfillment-namely, the failed Ludendorff offen­
sive of "March 2 1 , 19 1 8 " 65-succeed in the world of hallucination. As a132
Film
camera shot, and after "an eternity in the trenches, "66 an attack is noth­
ing short of redemption:
Only rarely does the enemy appear to us . . . in flesh and blood, even though we
are separated only by a narrow, torn-up field strip. We've been hunkering down in
the trenches for weeks and months, swarms of projectiles showering down upon
us, surrounded by thunderstorms. It happens that we almost forget we are fight­
ing against human beings. The enemy manifests itself as the unfolding of a gigan­
tic, impersonal power, as fate that thrusts its fist into the unseen.
When we storm forward and climb out of the trenches, and we see the empty,
unknown land in front of us where death goes about its business between flaring
columns of smoke, it appears as if a new dimension has opened up to us. Then we
suddenly see up close, in camouflage coats and in faces covered with mud like a
ghostly apparition, what awaits us in the land of the dead: the enemy. That is an
unforgettable moment.
How differently one had envisioned the scene. The blooming edge of a for­
est, a flowery meadow, and guns banging into the spring. Death as a flurrying
back and forth between the two trench lines of twenty-year-olds. Dark blood on
green blades of grass, bayonets in the morning light, trumpets and flags, a happy,
shimmering dance.67
But contemporary technologies of the body have done their duty, in
military as well as choreographic terms. When war and cinema coincide,
a communications zone becomes the front, the medium of propaganda
becomes perception, and the movie theater of Douchy the scheme or
schemes for an otherwise invisible enemy. " When our storm signals flash
across, [the English] get ready for a wrestling match about bits and pieces
of trenches, forests, and the edge of villages. But when we clash in the
haze of fire and smoke, then we become one, then we become two parts
of one force, fused into one body. "68 Lieutenant Junger meets his imagi­
nary other, as Lacan will define it in 193 6: as a mirror image that might
restore the body of the soldier, dismembered fourteen times, back to
wholeness.69 If only were there no war and the other not a doppelganger.
For "all cruelty, all the compilation of the most ingenious brutalities, can­
not fill a human being with as much horror as the momentary apparition
of his mirror image appearing in front of him, [with] all the fiery marks
of prehistory reflected in his distorted face. " 70
]Unger's film breaks off at precisely this image, long before Gravity's
Rainbow ends in the blackout of a real or filmed rocket hit above Uni­
versal Studios of California. For once the enemy was recognized as a dop­
pelganger, "then, in the last fire, the dark curtain of horror may well haveFilm
I33
lifted in the brains, but what was behind, lying in wait, the rigid mouth
could no longer speak. "71
Ludendorff and Jiinger's falling storm troopers are silent, either be­
cause ( following a hermeneutic tautology) they are falling, or because
(following a media-technological analysis) their a priori is the silent film.
Now, however, we have war films with sound that can spell out the puz­
zle behind the dark curtain of horror. What was lying in wait were first
of all facts that Jiinger systematically bypassed: the failure of the Luden­
dorff offensive, the retreat to the Siegfried position, and capitulation. Sec­
ond, and more horrific still, the film doppelganger harbored the possibil­
ity of fiction. A cinematic war may not even take place at all. Invisible en­
emies that materialize only for seconds and as ghostly apparitions can
hardly be said any longer to be killed: they are protected from death by
the false immortality of ghosts.
In Gravity's Rainbow, the novel about the Second World War itself,
GI von Held asks celebrated film director Gerhardt von Gall (alias Springer,
Lubitsch, Pabst, etc.) about the fate of a German rocket technologist who
had fallen into the hands of the Red Army:
"But what if they did shoot him ? "
"No. They weren't supposed to. "
"Springer. This ain't the fucking movies now, come on. "
" Not yet. Maybe not quite yet. You'd better enjoy it while you can. Someday,
when the film is fast enough, the equipment pocket-size and burdenless and
selling at people's prices, the lights and booms no longer necessary, then .
then . . "72

Total use of media instead of total literacy: sound film and video cam­
eras as mass entertainment liquidate the real event. In Storm of Steel no­
body except for the diary keeper survives, in Gravity's Rainbow all the
people pronounced dead return, even the rocket technician of Peene­
munde. Under the influence of the fictitious drug Oneirine, the writing of
world-war novels turns into movie fiction.
It is widely known that war-from the sandbox models of the Prus­
sian General Staff to the computer games of the Americans-has become
increasingly simulable. "But there, too," as these same general staffs wisely
recognized, "the last question remains unanswered, because death and the
enemy cannot 'be factored in realistically."'73 Friedlaender, media-techno­
logically as always, has drawn from this the daring, inverted conclusion:
for death in battle to coincide with cinema would be its own death.134

For many years Professor Pschorr had been preoccupied with one of the
most interesting problems of film: his ideal was to achieve the optical repro­
duction of nature, art, and fantasy through a stereoscopic projection appa­
ratus that would place its three-dimensional constructs into space without
the aid of a projection screen. Up to this point, film and other forms of pho­
tography had been pursued only in one-eyed fashion. Pschorr used stereo­
scopic double lenses everywhere and, eventually, indeed achieved three­
dimensional constructs that were detached from the surface of the projec­
tion screen. When he had come that close to his ideal, he approached the
Minister of War to lecture him about it. " But my dear Professor," the Min­
ister smiled, "what has your apparatus got to do with our technology of
maneuvers and war ? " The Professor looked at him with astonishment and
imperceptibly shook his inventive head. It was incredible to him that the
Minister did not have the foresight to recognize how important that appara­
tus was destined to become in times of war and peace. "Dear Minister, " he
insisted, "would you permit me to take some shots of the maneuver so that
you can convince yourself of the advantages of my apparatus ? " "I'd rather
not," the Minister contemplated, " but you are trustworthy. You know the
dangerous article on high treason, of course, and will surely keep the se­
cret." He granted the Professor unlimited access.
A couple of weeks after
the maneuver, all the generals gathered in open terrain that was in part
rolling, mountainous, and wooded, and that contained several large ponds
and ravines, slopes, and a couple of villages. "First, dear Minister and hon­
ored generals, allow me to tell you that the whole landscape, including our
own bodies, appears as nothing but a single, purely optical phantasmagoria.
What is purely optical in it I will make disappear by superimposing projec­
tions of other things onto it. " He variously combined beams of floodlights
and switched on a film reel, which began to run. Immediately the terrain
transformed: forests became houses, villages became deserts, lakes and
ravines became charming meadows; and suddenly one could see bustling
military personnel engaged in battle. Of course, as they were stepping or
riding into a meadow, they disappeared into a pond or a ravine. Indeed,
even the troops themselves were frequently only optical illusions, so that
real troops could no longer distinguish them from fake ones, and henceFilm
135
engaged in involuntary deceptions. Artillery lines appeared as pure optical
illusions. " Since the possibility exists of combining, precisely and simultane­
ously, optical with acoustic effects, these visible but untouchable cannons
can boom as well, making the illusion perfect, " said Pschorr. "By the way,
this invention is of course also useful for peaceful purposes. From now on,
however, it will be very dangerous to distinguish things that are only visible
from touchable ones. But life will become all the more interesting for it. "
Following this he let a bomber squadron appear on the horizon. Well, the
bombs were dropped, but they did their terrible damage only for the eye.
Strangely enough, the Minister of War in the end decided against purchas­
ing the apparatus. Full of anger, he claimed that war would become an im­
possibility that way. When the somewhat overly humanistic Pschorr exalted
that effect, the Minister erupted: " You cannot turn to the Minister of War
to put a dreadful end to war. That falls under the purview of my colleague,
the Minister of Culture. " As the Minister of Culture prepared to buy the
apparatus, his plans were vetoed by the Minister of Finance. In brief: the
state was unwilling to buy. Now the film corporation (the largest film trust)
helped itself. Ever since this moment, film has become all-powerful in the
world; but only through optical means. It is, quite simply, nature once
again, in all its visibility and audibility. When a storm is brewing, for exam­
ple, it is unclear whether this storm is only optically real or a real one
through and through. Abnossah Pschorr has been exercising arbitrary tech­
nological power over the fata morgana, so that even the Orient fell into
confusion when a recent fata morgana produced by solely technical
means-conjuring Berlin and Potsdam for desert nomads-was taken for
real. Pschorr rents out every desired landscape to innkeepers. Surrounding
Kulick's Hotel zur Wehmut these days is the Vierwaldstatter Lake. Herr v.
Ohnehin enjoys his purely optical spouse. Mullack the proletarian resides in
a purely optical palace, and billionaires protect their castles through their
optical conversion into shacks.
Not too long ago, a doppelganger factory was established . . . . In the
not too distant future, there will be whole cities made of light; entirely dif­
ferent constellations not only in the planetarium, but everywhere in nature
as well. Pschorr predicts that we will also be able to have technological con­
trol over touch in a similar way: not until then will radio traffic with real
bodies set in, which means not just film but life, and which will leave far
behind all traffic technologies . . .136
Film
The Minister of War's question about what Pschorr's apparatus has to do
with the technology of maneuvers and war is the only fiction in Fried­
laender's text. Even in its experimental prehistory, that is, even before it
became cinema, film conditioned new bodies. But ministers of war were
in touch with current developments.
In 1 89 1 , Georges Demeny, Marey's assistant and anatomist at the In­
stitute, began work on his Photography of Speech. Initially, his purpose
in conducting this strange exercise was to advance the breakdown of dis­
course into separate subroutines. In his experiments, motoric and optic
data were to be on an equal footing with the sensory and acoustic data
derived from Edison's phonograph. And Marey's silent chronophotograph
was the perfect instrument for their storage.
Hence a serial camera with shutter speeds in the milliseconds was
aimed at Demeny himself, who adhered to the honor-common during
the founding age of modern media-of performing simultaneously as ex­
perimenter and subject, priest and victim of the apparatus. A human
mouth opened, expectorated the syllables "Vi-ve la Fran-cel " and closed
again, while the camera dissected, enlarged, stored, and immortalized its
successive positions, including the " fine play of all facial muscles, " in
�omponent parts with a frequency of 16 Hz. To contemporaries, "many
of these oral movements appeared exaggerated because our eye cannot
perceive fleeting movements such as these, but the camera makes them
visible by bringing motion to a standstill. " 74 But that was precisely the
point. Edison was rumored to have been enamored of the enlarged shots
of his colleague's mouth.75
Based on the data of a freeze-framed patriotism, Demeny (fascinated
by physical impairments, as is every media technologist) first revolution­
ized instruction for deaf and mute people. Patients of the Hotel de Ville
in Paris were asked to synthesize acoustically the mouth positions film
had analyzed optically. Then they could-in "oral examinations" that
proved sensationaF6-scream "Vi-ve la Fran-cel " without ever hearing a
syllable. In the material battles soon to come, when the Joffre divisions
stormed and died like flies, self-perception was hardly necessary anymore.
"As early as 1 892," Demeny "envisioned all the procedures that have
since been in use in so-called cinematographic apparatuses and which are
nothing but reversible chronophotographs."77 One only would have had
to follow the principles of the revolver and supplement a rotating photo
storage device with a rotating photo projector. But even though Demeny
was envious of the Lumieres' success, research into slow motion was
more important than the illusions of feature films. He remained faithfulDemeny says, "Vi-ve la Fran-ee! "I38

to the chronophotographic gun and moved from studying single patriotic
mouths to masses of patriotic legs. On official assignment from the
French army, he filmed the traditional goose step in order to optimize it.78
What physiologists of art ( of all people) announced in I 897 as a new
feedback loop between psychophysics, maneuver drills, and the uncon­
scious was realized to the letter. Regarding the "condition we call 'think­
ing,'" Georg Hirth wrote:
That condition as well becomes automatized following frequent repetitIOn;
namely, when optical, acoustic, and other stimuli-which effect every closing ap­
perception-recur in roughly periodic intervals and in a known intensity. Recall,
for example, the activity of a marksman in a shooting gallery. At the beginning of
his service, the man is thoroughly infused with the condition of conscious and
prospective attentiveness: gradually, however, he becomes sure and relaxed; after
each bullet hits he steps mechanically up front to show the mark. His attention
can go for a walk-it returns to business only if the impact is delayed long enough
for his automatic-rhythmic feeling to subside. The same is true for the recruit dur­
ing his exercises. Indeed, the whole debate surrounding the length of active mili­
tary service revolves around the question: how long does it take to automatize the
military (moral as well as technical) memory structure of the average twenty-year­
old in such a way that the apparatus does not fail in the real-life event and that
the attention (attentiveness)-which every man must be equipped with at any
time in times of war and peace-is not absorbed by mindless service?79
Mechanization Takes Command -Sigfried Giedion could not have
come up with a better title for a book that retraces the path from Marey's
chronophotographic gun via modern art to military-industrial ergonom­
ics. The automatized weapons of world wars yet to come demanded sim­
ilarly automatized, average people as " apparatuses" whose motions-in
terms of both precision and speed-could only be controlled by filmic
slow motion. Since they were introduced during revolutionary civil wars,
exclamations such as "Vive la France! " had nurtured the death drive only
psychologically and had left the reaction time at the gun to a "thinking"
that exists only in quotation marks for physiologists of art and film.
Storm-troop leaders such as Junger, however, have since Ludendorff
been trained to work in time frames below any threshold of perception.
The apparition of the enemy appears to them only "for one second,"
barely perceptible, but measurable. As Junger notes immediately prior to
the Ludendorff offensive, "phosphoric digits are glowing on the watch on
my wrist. Watch digits, an unusual word.80 It is 5 :30. We'll begin to storm
in one hour. " 8 1 Two common items of today, trench coats (or, literally,
"coats for the trenches " ) and watches with second hands, are the prod-Film

ucts of the First World War.82 In the standardized j ump of the second
hand, film transport imposes its rhythm upon average people. No wonder
that storm-troop leader JUnger hallucinated the body of the enemy-that
unreality hidden for months in the trenches-in the medium of film. The
opponent could only be a film doppelganger. Demeny, we recall, had stan­
dardized the movements of a whole army through chronophotography.140
Film
And Professor Pschorr, as always, only had to do his excessive share
to transform the " bodies" of soldiers and the entire landscape of their
maneuver into "a single, purely optical phantasmagoria," which, more­
over, could be combined precisely and simultaneously with acoustic
effects.
A fata morgana machine that can now be had around the globe.
Without war, simply by paying an admission fee. For mechanization has
also taken command over so-called times of leisure and peace. Night af­
ter night, every discotheque repeats Demeny's goose-step analyses. The
stroboscopic effect at the beginning of film has left physiological labs and
now chops up dancers twenty times per second into film images of them­
selves. The barrage of fire has left the major lines of combat and these
days echoes from security systems-including their precise and simulta­
neous combination with optical effects. Demeny's photography of speech
continues as a videoclip, his "Vi-ve la Fran-ce ! " as a salad of syllables:
"Dance the Mussolini! Dance the Adolf Hitler! " 83
Deaf, mute, and blind, bodies are brought up to the reaction speed of
World War n+ I , as if housed in a gigantic simulation chamber. Comput­
erized weapons systems are more demanding than automatized ones. If
the joysticks of Atari video games make children illiterate, President Rea­
gan welcomed them for just that reason: as a training ground for future
bomber pilots. Every culture has its zones of preparation that fuse lust
and power, optically, acoustically, and so on. Our discos are preparing
our youths for a retaliatory strike.
War has always already been madness, film's other subject. Body
movements, as they are provoked by the stroboscopes of today's dis­
cotheques, went by a psychopathological name a century ago: a "large
hysterical arc." Wondrous ecstasies, twitchings without end, circus-like
contortions of extremities were reason enough to call them up with all the
means of hypnosis and auscultation. A lecture hall full of medical stu­
dents, as yet all male, was allowed to watch the master, Charcot, and his
female patients.
A handwritten note [in the as yet unpublished archives of the Salpetrierel gives an
account of the session of November 2 5 , 1 8 77. The subject exhibits hysterical
spasms; Charcot suspends an attack by placing first his hand, then the end of a
baton, on the woman's ovaries. He withdraws the baton, and there is a fresh at­
tack, which he accelerates by administering inhalations of amyl nitrate. The af­
flicted woman then cries out for the sex-baton in words that are devoid of
metaphor: " G. is taken away and her delirium continues." 84Film
141
The Salpetriere makes iconographs o f its hysteria.
But this performance was not, or not any longer, the truth about hys­
teria: what was produced by psychopathic media was not allowed simply
to disappear in secret memories or documents. Technological media had
to be able to store and reproduce it. Charcot, who transformed the
Salpetriere from a dilapidated insane asylum into a fully equipped re­
search lab shortly after his appointment, ordered his chief technician in
1 8 83 to start filming. Whereupon Albert Londe, later known as the con­
structor of the Rolleiflex camera,85 anatomized (strictly following Muy­
bridge and Marey) the "large hysterical are" with serial cameras. A young
physiology assistant from Vienna visiting the Salpetriere was watching.86
But Dr. Freud did not make the historical connection between films of
hysteria and psychoanalysis. As in the case of phonography, he clung (in
the face of other media) to the verbal medium and its new decomposition
into letters.
For this purpose, Freud first stills the pictures that the bodies of his
female patients produce: he puts them on his couch in the Berggasse. Then
a talking cure is deployed against the images seen or hallucinated. With­
out mentioning the gender difference between male obsessive-neurosis
and female hysteria, in Studies on Hysteria he observes:
When memories return in the form of pictures our task is in general easier than
when they return as thoughts. Hysterical patients, who are as a rule of a "visual"
type, do not make such difficulties for the analyst as those with obsessions.
Once a picture has emerged from the patient's memory, we may hear him say
that it becomes fragmentary and obscure in proportion as he proceeds with the
description of it. The patient is, as it were, getting rid of it by turning it into142
Film
words. We go on to examine the memory picture itself in order to discover the di­
rection in which our work is to proceed. "Look at the picture once more. Has it
disappeared? " "Most of it, yes, but I still see this detail. " "Then this residue must
still mean something. Either you will see something new in addition to it, or some­
thing will occur to you in connection with it. " When this work has been accom­
plished, the patient's field of vision is once more free and we can conjure up an­
other picture. On other occasions, however, a picture of this kind will remain ob­
stinately before the patient's inward eye, in spite of his having described it; and
this is an indication to me that he still has something important to tell me about
the topic of the picture. As soon as this has been done the picture vanishes, like a
ghost that has been laid.87
Naturally, such sequences of images in hysterics or visually oriented
people are an inner film: as in the case of psychoanalytical dream theory,
a "pathogenic recollection," notwithstanding the patient's "forms of re­
sistance and his pretexts, " provokes its optical "reproduction. "88 When
Otto Rank subjected The Student of Prague, as the second German au­
teur film, to psychoanalytical examination in 19 14, he observed that
"cinematography . . . in numerous ways reminds us of dream-work. "
Which, conversely, meant that internal images were modeled, as with hys­
terics, after the "shadowy, fleeting, but impressive scenes" of film. Con­
sequently, "the technique of psychoanalysis, " which "generally aims at
uncovering deeply buried and significant psychic material, on occasion
proceeding from the manifest surface evidence, . . . need not shy away
from even some random and banal subject"-such as "the film-drama"­
"if the matter at hand exhibits psychological problems whose sources and
implications are not obvious. " 89
But this rather filmic uncovering, the return from the cinema to the
soul, from manifest surface or celluloid skin to unconscious latency, from
a technological to a psychic apparatus, only replaces images with words.
While optical data in film are storable, they are also "shadowy, fleeting" :
one cannot look them up, as with books (or today's videotapes). This in­
tangibility governs Rank's methodology. "Those whose concern is with
literature may be reassured by the fact that the scenarist of this film, The
Student of Prague, is an author currently in vogue and that he has ad­
hered to prominent patterns, the effectiveness of which has been tested by
time. "90 Which is why psychoanalysis (to paraphrase Freud) basically im­
itates the doppelganger film by translating it into words. Rank's discus­
sion of the doppelganger quotes all available sources from I 800 on and
turns movies back into literature.91
For a talking cure, nothing else is left to do. Still, after attendingFilm
143
Londe's filmings o f hysteria, Freud did just the opposite with it. Literally,
psychoanalysis means chopping up an internal film, in steps that are as
methodical as they are discrete, until all of its images have disappeared.
They break to pieces one by one, simply because female patients have to
translate their visions into depictions or descriptions. In the end the me­
dium of the psychoanalyst triumphs, because he stills bodily movements
and slays the remaining, internal sightings like so many ghosts or Dracu­
las. When Freud "unlocks images, " he does so not to store them, as Char­
cot does, but to decode the puzzles of their signifiers. Thus, the emergence
particularly of nonverbal storage technologies around 1900 leads to a dif­
ferentiation that establishes discourse as a medium among media. Freud
the writer is still willing to admit the competition of the phonograph, be­
cause gramophony (despite all its differences with the talking cure and its
case-study novels) deals with words. The competition of silent film, how­
ever, Freud does not even acknowledge. And even if Abraham and Sachs
operate as " psychoanalytical collaborators" on a 19 26 project that makes
The Mysteries of the Unconscious into a film, and hence teaches contem­
poraries "the necessities of modern-day education without pain and job
training, " 92 Freud himself flatly denies an offer from Hollywood.
This differentiation of storage media decides the fate of madness.
Psychoanalytical discourse, which, following Lacan's thesis, is a conse­
quence and displacement of hysterical discourse, translates the most beau­
tiful pathology into the symbolic. At the same time, the serial photogra­
phy of psychiatry, understood as the trace detection it is, stores the real
along the "great hysterical arc . " Londe's still shots of each individual
twitch and ecstasy travel (due to a lack of opportunities for projecting
films) into the multivolume Iconography of the Salphriere. There they
rest, but only to emigrate henceforth from the real and to return to the
imaginary, for which Freud had no use. For although the "great hysterical
arc" can no longer be found in the lecture halls of today's medical
schools, the countless jugendstil images of women, with their bows and
twists, can only derive from this iconographie photographique.93 Works
of art of the jugendstil did not simply suffer from the age of their techno­
logical reproducibility; in their style, they themselves reproduced mea­
sured data and hence practiced the precise application Muybridge had as­
cribed from the very beginning to his study of Animal Loco� otion.
Hysteria, however, became as omnipresent as it became fleeting. In
the real, it gave rise to archives of trace detection that returned in the
imaginary of the paintings of the jugendstil; in the symbolic, it gave rise
to a science that returned in the female hysterics of Hofmannsthal's dra-I44

mas.94 One reproduction chased the other. With the result that madness
might not take place under conditions of high technology. It becomes, like
war, a simulacrum.
A successor to Londe, Dr. Hans Hennes of the Provinzial-Heil- und
Pflegeanstalt Bonn, almost managed to figure out this ruse. His treatise on
Cinematography in the Service of Neurology and Psychiatry identified
only one appropriate medium for the "wealth of hysterical motoric mal­
functions" : filming. In a manner "more visual and complete than the bestFilm
145
description" (and presumably photographs a s well) ,95 technological me­
dia reproduced psychopathological ones. But since serial photographs
could be projected as films by 1909, Hennes went one step beyond Londe.
Not until psychiatry was in a position "to convert a rapid succession of
movements into a slow one through cinematographic reproduction" was
it possible to see things "whose precise observation is, in real life, hardly
or not at all possible. " 96 As if cinema had enlarged the madness (of both
patients and physicians) through the whole realm of unreality and fiction;
as if Hennes had, in vague anticipation of McLuhan, understood the me­
dium as the message. For "in all cases . . . it was typical that distraction
from the symptoms of the disease and the suspension of external stimuli
were sufficient to reduce, or almost completely eliminate, [hysterical]
movements. By contrast, it is enough to draw attention to phenomena, or
for the physician to examine the patient, even just step up to him, in or­
der for dysfunctions to appear with greater intensity. " 97
That is how psychiatry-whose attention had lately been running on
automatic pilot, that is, filmic ally-itself discovered Charcot's simple se­
cret, long before Foucault ever did; namely, that every test produces what
it allegedly only reproduces. According to Dr. Hennes, who is fearless
about contradicting himself and could even describe the doctor's attention
as a contraindication after recommending it a moment before, it is quite
likely that there would be no madness without filming it:
How often does it happen to the professor that a patient fails during a lecture,
that a manic suddenly changes his mood, a catatonic suddenly fails to perform his
stereotyped movements. Although he executed his pathological movements with­
out disturbance on the ward, the changed environment of the lecture hall has the
effect of not letting him produce his peculiarities-so that he does not display
precisely what the professor wanted him to demonstrate. Other patients show
their interesting oddities "maliciously, " only when there are no lectures, continu­
ing education courses, and so on. Such occurrences, which are frequently dis­
turbing to the clinical lecturer, are almost completely corrected by the cinemato­
graph. The person doing the filming is in a position to wait calmly for the best
possible moment to make the recording. Once the filming is done, the pictures are
available for reproduction at any moment. Film is always "in the mood. " There
are no failures.98
That means that films are more real than reality and that their so­
called reproductions are, in reality, productions. A psychiatry beefed up
by media technologies, a psychiatry loaded with scientific presumptions,
flips over into an entertainment industry. In view of the "rapid dissemi­
nation of this invention and the unmatched popularity it has attained insuch a short time, "99 Hennes advises his profession to create, "through
collective participation and collaboration, a cinematographic archive
analogous to the phonographic one . " l OO
Hence it is no wonder that the " great hysterical arc" disappears from
nosology or the world shortly after its storage on film. Since there are " no
failures " and mad people on film are " always 'in the mood,' " inmates of
insane asylums can forgo their performances and withhold their " inter­
esting oddities 'maliciously'" from all storage media. At the same time,
psychiatrists no longer have to hunt for their ungrateful human demon­
stration material. The only thing they have to do is shoot silent films,
which as such (through the isolation of movements from the context of
all speech) already envelop their stars in an aura of madness. To say noth­
ing of the many possible film tricks that could chop up and reassemble
these body movements, until the simulacrum of madness was perfect.
The age of media (not just since Turing's game of imitation) renders
indistinguishable what is human and what is machine, who is mad and
who is faking it. If cinematographers can " correct in an almost perfect
way" disturbing occurrences of non-madness, they might as well film
paid actors instead of asylum inmates. Although the historiography of
film presumes a line of development from fairground entertainment to ex­
pressionist film art, it is closer to the truth to speak of an elegant leap
from experimental setups into an entertainment industry. Actors, that is,
the doppelgangers of the psychiatrically engineered insane, visited the
mOVle screen.
Certainly, Dr. Robert Wiene's Cabinet of Dr. Caligari ( 1920) seems to
see cinema itself as part of the genealogy of the circus. The action as a
whole confronts small-town life and vagrants. The titular hero appears as
a traveling circus artist accompanied by a somnambulist medium who
predicts the future for Caligari's paying customers. But the paths leading
from the fairgrounds to Caligari are as tenuous as those leading (accord­
ing to Siegfried Kracauer's simplified sociological reading) From Caligari
to Hitler. In film and/or history, mass hysterias are, rather, the effect of
massively used media technologies, which in turn have solid scientific
foundation in theories of the unconscious. Caligari's wagon moves to­
ward the motorcade of the Third Reich.
That is why Caligari's title of " Dr. " remains the vacuous presump­
tion of a charlatan only in Carl Mayer's and Hans Janowitz's draft of
the screenplay, a charlatan who misuses his medium Cesare as a remote­
controlled murder weapon and who ends up in a straitjacket in an insane
asylum once his ruse has been found out. The fairground is conquered byFilm
147
an order whose disruptions not coincidentally have cost the lives of a mu­
nicipal office worker and a youthful aesthete, two people, moreover, who
are interested in books. As if screenplays as well had to defend script as
their medium.
Following an idea of the great Fritz Lang,101 however, the completed
film frames the action in a way that represents not only the transvalua­
tion of all values but also their enigmatization. Citizens and mad people
exchange their roles. In the framed story, the youthful hero kills Caligari
and in the process underscores his bourgeois media love for female read­
ers and books. In the framing story, he turns mad, and driven by his
crazed love he stalks another person in the asylum, the alleged lover of
the female reader. His private war against Caligari shrinks to the optical
hallucination of a paranoid. As if the film attempted to uncover the
pathology of a medium that entwined reading and loving but has abdi­
cated its power to film. The madwoman simply does not register loving
glances anymore.
Caligari, however ( or, at any rate, a face that looks just like his), tow­
ers above the insane asylum of the framing story as director and psychia­
trist. No murder charges can prevail against his power to make a diagno­
sis such as paranoia. Apparently, "while the original story exposed the
madness inherent in authority, " the eventual film "glorified authority"
simply because it "convicted its antagonist of madness. " 102 But Kracauer's
attack against undefined authorities fails to take into account a psychiatry
whose effects have produced new beings, not just Carl Mayer's biograph­
ical experiences with German military psychiatrists during the war. 1 03
It is precisely this indistinguishability between framed and framing
story, between insanity and psychiatry, that does j ustice to film technol­
ogy. Nothing prevents the asylum director in the narrative frame to act si­
multaneously as the mad Caligari. It is only that such ascriptions are
communicated via the symbolic order of doctoral titles or the stories of
patients, which are not part of the silent film. The identity between psy­
chiatrist and murderer remains open-ended because it is offered to the
eyes only and is not institutionalized by any word. A never-commented­
upon similarity between faces renders all readings indistinguishable.
That is how faithfully Wiene's film follows cinematographically mod­
ernized psychiatry. When professorial media technologists of the found­
ing age conduct their experiments, they simultaneously play project di­
rector and subject, murderer and victim, psychiatrist and madman, but
storage technologies do not want to, and cannot, record this difference.
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Stevenson's fictitious doppelganger pair of148
Film
1 8 8 6, are only the pseudonyms of actual privy councilors. A gramophone
records the words of Stransky, the psychiatrist, as a salad of syllables; a
chronophotograph records the patriotic grimacing of Demeny. The situa­
tion in Wiene's feature film is no different. Filmed psychiatrists go mad of
necessity, especially if they, like the director of the asylum, declare an old
book explicable in psychiatric as well as media-technological terms.
Somnambulism. A Compendium of the University of Uppsala. Pub­
lished in the year I 72 6 : Thus reads the Fraktur-Iettered title of the book
that the asylum director studies in order to learn everything about a his­
torical "mystic, Dr. Caligari," and his "somnambulist by the name of Ce­
sare . " Likewise, Charcot and his assistants studied dust-covered files on
witches and the obsessed as they were transforming mysticism into a psy­
chiatrically proper diagnosis of hysteria.lo4 The researchers of hypnosis,
Dr. Freud and Dr. Caligari, are thus doppelgangers. l OS The one "found"
the Oedipus complex for purposes of diagnosis and therapy initially "in
my own case" ;106 the other, according to the film's subtitle, "under the
domination of a hallucination" reads a sentence in white letters written
on the walls of the asylum: " YOU MUST BECOME CALIGARI. " Charges that
"the director" must, for one, be mad and, second, "be Caligari" are to no
avail, because modern experimenters say or do the same thing much more
clearly-namely, immorally-than bourgeois heroes do. The similarity
between psychiatrists and madmen, an enigma throughout the whole film,
originates from research strategies and technologies.
The fact that an asylum director is directed by hallucinated writings
to become Caligari in the framed story is simply a film trick. An actor
plays both roles. With celluloid and cuts (the weapons of Dr. Wiene) Dr.
Caligari or his official doppelganger emerges victorious.
It is only because of a life-size puppet that simulates Cesare sleeping
in somnambulist stiffness that the title hero can provide his medium with
protective alibis while executing nightly murders under the influence of
hypnotic orders. The puppet deceives the bourgeois hero (as contempo­
rary theories On the Psychology of the Uncanny predicted). 107 Prior to
the introduction of stuntmen (and much to the dismay of aesthetes), films
engaged in the " frequently used practice of replacing the artist with a
puppet in particularly dangerous scenes. " 108 Thus, Cesare is always al­
ready a silent movie medium, and it is for this reason alone that he can be
a somnambulistic and murderous medium. The photograph taken with a
camera obscura (the cabinet in the title of the film itself ) learns to move;
the Iconographie photographique de la Salpetriere enters into Albert
Londe's filming stage. As the mobilization of his puppet alibi, CesareFilm
I49
walks stiffly and with raised arms; he stumbles, tries to regain his balance,
and finally rolls down a slope. Dr. Hennes describes in virtually identical
terms the " accident hysteria" of his patient Johann L., who is " 6 I years
old" and a "workhorse" : "He walks in straddle-legged and stiff fashion,
and often tilts as he turns around; moreover, he patters and walks in small
steps; this gait is accompanied by grotesque ancillary movements of his
arms, and is, in general, so bizarre that it appears artificially exagger­
ated. " Nothing but indescribables, for which, however, "the cinemato­
graphic image presented a very vivid illustration and supplement. " 1 09
And that-when bizarreness and artificial exaggeration originate in
a hypnotic command-is above all when pathology and experiment co­
incide once again. Cesare operates as the weapon of Caligari the artist.
Psychiatrists constructed the first cruise missile systems, reusable systems
to boot, long before cyberneticists did. With the serial murders of Cesare
(and his numerous descendants in cinema), the seriality of film images
enters plot itself. That is why his hypnosis hypnotizes moviegoers. In
Wiene's pictures, they fall victim to a trompe l'oeil whose existence Lacan
demonstrated through historical periods of painting: the incarnate look of
a power that affected pictures long before it created them,l1O or that even
produced that look as pictures. Yesterday the accident hysteric Johann L.,
today Cesare, tomorrow movie fans themselves. With the somnambulism
of his medium, Dr. Caligari already programs "the collective hypnosis "
into which the " darkness of the theatre and the glow of the screen " 1 1 1
transport a n audience.
Film doppelgangers film filming itself. They demonstrate what happens to
people who are in the line of fire of technological media. A motorized
mirror image travels into the data banks of power.
Barbara La Marr, the subtitle heroine of a novel by Arnolt Bronnen
with the cynical title Film and Life ( I927), experienced it herself. She had
just finished doing her first screen tests for Hollywood and was sitting
next to the director Fitzmaurice in the darkened projection room while
film buyers were examining her body.
Barbara suddenly got frightened. She stopped breathing. She clutched her chest;
was her heart still beating; what happened on the screen? Something terrible
stared at her, something strange, ugly, unknown; that wasn't she, that couldn't be
she who stared at her, looked to the left, to the right, laughed, cried, walked, fell,
who was that? The reel rolled, the projectionist switched on the light. Fitzmaurice
looked at her.
" Well?" She regained her composure, smiled. "Oh. That is how angels up in150
Film
heaven must look down upon us, the way I look in this picture. " Fitzmaurice dis­
agreed laughingly: "I would never have thought of you as an angel. But that is not
bad at all. In fact, just the opposite. Better than I thought. Much better." But she
got up, trembling, it erupted from within her, almost screaming: " totally bad,"
she screamed, "terrible, ghastly, mean, I am completely untalented, nothing will
become of me, nothing, nothing! " 112
Film transforms life into a form of trace detection, just as literature
during Goethe's time transformed truth into an educational discipline.
Media, however, are ruthless, while art glosses over. One does not have
to be hypnotized, like the mad Cesare, to become strange, ugly, unknown,
terrible, ghastly, mean, in brief, "nothing" on the screen. It happens to
each and everyone, at least before the plots of feature films (following the
logic of phantasms and the real) begin to obscure the undesirable. A pro­
tagonist of one of Nabokov's novels goes to the movies with his girlfriend,
unexpectedly sees his "doppelganger" (following his brief engagement as
a movie extra months earlier) , and feels "not only shame but also a sense
of the fleeting evanescence of human life."J13 Bronnen's title Film and Life
hence repeats the classic line of the stick-up man, "Your money or your
life ! " Whoever chooses money loses his life anyway; whoever chooses life
without money will die shortly thereafter.ll4
The reason is technological: films anatomize the imaginary picture of
the body that endows humans (in contrast to animals) with a borrowed I
and, for that reason, remains their great love. Precisely because the cam­
era operates as a perfect mirror, it liquidates the fund of stored self-images
in La Marr's psychic apparatus. On celluloid all gesticulations appear
more ridiculous, on tapes, which bypass the skeletal sound transmission
from larynx to ear, voices have no timbre, on ID cards (according to Pyn­
chon, of whom no photo exists) a "vaguely criminal face" appears, "its
soul snatched by the government camera as the guillotine shutter fell." 115
And all that not because media are lying but because their trace detection
undermines the mirror stage. That is to say: the soul itself, whose techno­
logical rechristening is nothing but Lacan's mirror stage. In Bronnen's
work, budding starlets must experience that, too.
Film is not for tender souls, Miss, . . . just like art in general. If you insist on
showing your soul-which nobody else is interested in, by the way; we are far
more interested in your body-you need to have a tough and hard-boiled soul;
otherwise it won't work. But I don't think you will achieve any particularly great
footage with your little indication of a soul. Let go of your soul without getting
bent out of shape. I had to learn it myself, to let go of my inner self. Today I do
films; back then I was poet.116Film
151
The true words of a deserter who has grasped the difference between
media and the arts. Even the most poetic of words could not store bodies.
The soul, the inner self, the individual: they all were only the effects of an
illusion, neutralized through the hallucination of reading and widespread
literacy. (Alphabetise, as Lacan put it. ) 1 17 When, in the last romantic com­
edy, Buchner's King Peter of the kingdom of Popo searched for his son
Leonce, who was at large, he put the police of the Archduchy of Hessia
once more in an embarrassing situation. They could only go by "the
'wanted poster,' the description, the certificate" of a "person, " "subject,"
"individual," "delinquent," and so on: "walks on two feet, has two arms,
also a mouth, a nose, two eyes. Distinguishing features: a highly danger­
ous individual." 118
That is how far literature went when it came to storing bodies-to
the point of individual generality, but no further. Which is why literary
doppelgangers, which began to show up in Goethe's time, appeared prin­
cipally to readers. In Goethe, Novalis, Chamisso, Musset-the unspeci­
fied warrant of the book's protagonist, whose appearance the texts leave
open, always merged with the unspecified warrant of a reader, whom the
texts addressed simply as a literate human being. 119
In 1 8 80, however, Alphonse Bertillon, chief of the Parisian Office of
Identification, blesses the criminal police forces of the earth with his an­
thropometric system: I I measurements of diverse body parts, all with a
rather constant, lifelong length, are sufficient for an exact registration,
since they already afford 177,147 possible combinations or individual­
izations. Furthermore, the police archive documents the name, surname,
pseudonym, age, as well as two photos (front and side ). From which
Moravagine, Cendrars's protagonist, deduces consequences for literature
three days before the outbreak of war in 19 1 4 . He starts on a flight
around the globe, naturally plans a film about himself, and chides the
cameraman for not coming along:
I can understand your wanting to rest and get back to your books . . . . You always
needed time to think about a whole pile of things, to look, to see, to compare and
record, to take notes on the thousand things you haven't had a chance to classify
in your own mind. But why don't you leave that to the police archives? Haven't
you got it through your head that human thought is a thing of the past and that
philosophy is worse than Bertillon's guide to harassed COpS?1 20
When Bertillon's police archive and Charcot's iconography, those two
complementary recording technologies, chop up the human being of phi­
losophy into countless criminals and lunatics, what results are doppel-152
Film
gangers on doppelgangers. And one only needs (as in Moravagine's case)
to supplant still photographs with a combination of motorization and film
to teach doppelgangers how to move. One no less than Mallarme already
celebrated the view through a moving car as that of a camera on
wheels;121 one no less than Schreber, during his relocation from the insane
asylum at Coswig to the one at Sonnenstein, "mistakes" all the "human
forms [that he] has seen on the drive and in the station in Dresden for
miraculous 'fleeting men."' l22 Traffic in the age of motorization always
means encountering doppelgangers, schematically and serially.
The shapes that come to the surface these days out of the depths of
mobile mirrors no longer have anything to do with literature and educa­
tion. In 1 8 8 6, Professor Ernst Mach described how he had recently seen
a stranger on a bus and had thought, " 'what a shabby-looking school­
master that is, who just got on."'123 It took even the great theorist of per­
ception a couple of practical milliseconds before he could identify that
stranger as his own mirror image. And Freud, who recapitulates Mach's
uncanny encounter in 19 19, can offer a traveling story of his own:
I was sitting alone in my wagon-lit compartment when a more than usually violent
jolt of the train swung back the door of the adjoining washing cabinet, and an el­
derly gentleman in a dressing-gown and a traveling cap came in. I assumed that in
leaving the washing-cabinet, which lay between the two compartments, he had
taken the wrong direction and come into my compartment by mistake. Jumping
up with the intention of putting him right, I at once realized to my dismay that the
intruder was nothing but my own reflection in the looking-glass on the open door.
I can still recollect that I thoroughly disliked his appearance. Instead, therefore, of
being frightened by our "doubles," both Mach and I simply failed to recognize
them as such. Is it not possible, though, that our dislike of them was a vestigial
trace of the archaic reaction which feels the "double" to be something uncanny?1 24
The horror of starlets like Barbara La Marr affects theorists as well.
At a hundred kilometers per hour, as soon as they participate in motorized
traffic, everyday life necessarily becomes cinematic. From the cabinet of
Dr. Freud emerges his other. In the archive of Bertillon or Charcot, profes­
sors appear as dirty old men who remind even the father of psychoanaly­
sis of his bodily functions. But the psychoanalysis of the uncanny does not
touch upon modern technologies of trace detection with as much as a sin­
gle word. Freud and Rank, in their hunt for the remainders of an archaic
reaction, return mobile mirrors to stationary ones once again, turn cinema
and railroad into the romantic world of books. The one deciphers the dop­
pelganger in E. T. A. Hoffmann, the other, in Chamisso and Musset.
Tzvetan Todorov observes that "the themes of fantastic literatureFilm
153
Scheme for a doppelganger shot.
have literally become the very themes of the psychological investigations
of the last fifty years . . . . We need merely mention that the double was
even in Freud's time the theme of a classic study ( Otto Rank's Der Dop­
pelganger). " 1 25 As a science of unconscious literalities, psychoanalysis in­
deed liquidates phantoms such as the doppelganger, whom romantic read­
ers once hallucinated between printed lines. In modern theory and litera­
ture "words have gained an autonomy which things have lost." 126 But to
ascribe the death of "the literature of the fantastic" solely to a "psycho­
analysis" that has "replaced" it and thereby made it " useless " 127 is
Todorov's critical-theoretical blind spot. Writers know better that theo­
ries and texts are variables dependent upon media technologies:
The writer of yesteryear employed "images" in order to have a "visual" effect.
Today language rich in images has an antiquated effect. And why is it that the im­
age disappears from front-page articles, essays, and critiques the way it disappears
from the walls of middle-class apartments ? In my judgment: because with film we
have developed a language that has evolved from visuality against which the vi­
suality developed from language cannot compete. Finally, language becomes pure,
clean, precise.128
Only in the competition between media do the symbolic and the
imaginary bifurcate. Freud translates the uncanny of the Romantic period
into science, Melies, into mass entertainment. It is precisely this fantasiz­
ing, anatomized by psychoanalysis, that film implements with powerful
effect. This bilateral assault dispels doppelgangers from their books,
which become devoid of pictures. On-screen, however, doppelgangers or
their iterations celebrate the theory of the unconscious as the technology
of cinematic cutting, and vice versa.
The doppelganger trick is nothing less than uncanny. Half of the lens
is covered with a black diaphragm while the actor acts on the other half1 54

of the picture frame. Then, without changing the camera's position, the
exposed film is rewound, the other half of the lens is covered up, and the
same actor, now in his role as the doppelganger, acts on the opposite side
of the frame. Put differently, Melies only had to record his stop trick onto
the same roll of celluloid twice. "A trick applied with intelligence, " he
declared, "can make visible that which is supernatural, invented, or
unreal. " 129
That is how the imaginary returned, more powerful than it could ever
be in books, and as if made to order for writers of entertainment litera­
ture. In 19 1 2, Heinz Ewers wrote: "I hate Thomas Alva Edison, because
we owe to him one of the most ghastly of inventions: the phonograph !
Yet I love him: h e redeemed everything when h e returned fantasy to the
matter-of-fact world-in the movies ! " 130
These are sentences of media-technological precision: whereas the
grooves of records store ghastly waste, the real of bodies, feature films
take over all of the fantastic or the imaginary, which for a century has
gone by the name of literature. Edison; or, the splitting of discourse into
white noise and imagination, speech and dream (not to mention hatred
and love). From then on neo-Romantic writers interested in love had it
easy. One year later, Ewers wrote the screenplay for The Student of
Prague by drawing on all of the book-doppelgangers in his library. !3! The
film trick to end all film tricks (or, as a contemporary review put it, "the
cinematic problem to end all cinematic problems " ) !32 conquered the

Ewers's Student, Gerhart Hauptmann's Phantom, Wiene's Caligari,
Lindau's Anderer, Wegener's Golem: a doppelganger boom. Books (since
Moses and Mohammed) have been writing writing; films are filming film­
ing. Where art criticism demands expressionism or self-referentiality, me­
dia have always been advertising themselves. Finally, motorists, train trav­
elers, and professors, starlets and criminals, madmen and psychiatrists­
they, too, recognized that camera angles are their everyday reality.
Doppelganger films magnify the unconscious in mobile mirrors; they dou­
ble doubling itself. The feature film transforms the "shock" 133 of the mo­
ment of recognition in Bronnen, Nabokov, Mach, and Freud into slow­
motion trace detection: for 50 minutes, until his eventual disintegration
and suicide, the student of Prague must see how the "horrifically un­
changing apparition of the 'other'" sees him. 1 34 Notwithstanding Walter
Bloem's The Soul of Cinema, cinema is what kills the soul. Precisely be­
cause "humans" are not "worms, for whom something like" division or
doubling "is a piece of cake, . . . the notion of a unified artistic personal­
ity" disintegrates. Mimes become stars because human beings or civil ser-156
Film
vants have been made into guinea pigs. When executing the doppelganger
trick, "mechanics becomes a coproducer. " 135
On October I I, 1 89 3 , The Other: A Play in Four Acts had its pre­
miere in Munich. In 1906, Paul Lindau's horror play was published by the
Reclam Universal Library only to land on the desks of the Royal Police
Force in Munich, from whose copy I must of necessity quote. For on
February I S , 19 1 3 , change overtook all libraries: The Other, consisting
of " 2,000 meters" and "five acts," appeared as the first German auteur
film. 136
"Men such as Paul Lindau, " Gottfried Benn wrote, "have their mer­
its and their immortality. " 137 They are among the first to make the change
from the pen to the typewriter and thus to produce texts suitable for film­
ing (the script of The Student of Prague was a typescript, toO).138 They are
among the first to make the change from the soul to mechanics and thus
to produce subject matter suitable for film; that is, doppelgangers. With
Lindau and Ewers, cinema in Germany becomes socially acceptable.
Except that Lindau's protagonist, Mr. HaIlers, J.D., has not yet
achieved wide cultural acceptance, for which poetic-filmic justice simply
compensates him with a double. In order to abolish a superannuated
civil-service ethos, HaIlers (j ust like Dr. Hyde or the student of Prague)
must first become the other of the title. At the beginning, late at night, the
prosecutor is in the process of dictating The Constraints of Willpower in
Light of Criminality to one of the last male secretaries, who takes it down
in shorthand. Lacking Lindau's typewriter, he also lacks any knowledge
of psychiatry. Hypnosis, suggestion, hysteria, the unconscious, split per­
sonality-the civil servant wants to take out of circulation all of these
terms, which have been in common usage "since Hippolyte Taine's study
on the intellect. " 139

A highly rhetorical performance, whose refutation begins with
Freudian slips and fills all four acts. Hallers's slips alone refute his dicta­
tion and his plaint, which turns into complete nonsense in its mechanical
reproduction (the gramophone function of all secretaries, from Lindau to
Valery).141 Foucault would have described historical ruptures no less de­
risively: justice ceding to medicine, law (with writing as the medium of
civil service) ceding to biotechnologies that are media technologies as
well. The same year, Senate President Schreber of the Regional Court of
Appeals in Dresden disappears into an asylum simply because a "con­
spiracy" of psychiatrists "denied" him (a lawyer) "professions, like that
of a nerve specialist, that lead to a closer proximity to God. " 142 Hence
Hallers, too, breaks off his dictation, because "pathologically strained
nerves" 143 are in dire need of the "testimony of an available nerve spe­
cialist and psychiatrist. " 144
Professor Feldermann makes a nightly house call, cannot convince his
patient of his split personality even by telling of classic case studies, and
concludes that his " dull, gnawing headache" is attributable to Hallers's
" fall from a horse . . . last fall. " 145 What must remain taboo in Light of
Criminality becomes an epistemic matter of course in Guyau's "Memory
and Phonograph" : consciousness and memory are mutually exclusive. In
the depths of his brain engrams, the disciple of free will is listening to the
dictates of the unconscious.
That is how the inevitable comes about. What the consciousness of
the lawyer denies, his body enacts. The other appears (as does, in Schre­
ber's case, a female other: a "sexually dependent woman" who appears in
the same position as the president of the senate) . 146 Hallers falls asleep as
a prosecutor only to wake up immediately as a criminal. His movements
become " automaton-like, " 147 "strained," "belabored and heavy, as if
against his Will." 148 Consequently, the other is (as in Caligari's case) the
same once again, but this time as a cinematographic guinea pig. "A bur­
glar" 149 has possessed the civil servant / person and, consequently, plans158
Film
to break in to Hallers's own villa together with some crooks from Berlin.
For whereas the lawyer half of his split personality surmises darkly only
that "I no longer am I am, " !50 the criminal half proudly announces, in the
unparalleled phrase of Yahweh, "I am . . . what I am. " !5! As in all cases
of split personality since Dr. Azam's Felida and Wagner's Kundry, uncon­
scious knowledge overreaches conscious knowledge, not the other way
round.!52 The other, with all of his complications, knows and steals from
Hallers's villa, while the prosecutor (who returns as such after falling
asleep a second time) only appears as an unintentional comedian when he
interrogates his accomplice. It is not until he is confronted with Professor
Feldermann's knowledge of psychiatry that he is brought up to par on
contemporary developments and brought to his renunciation of all unre­
strained willpower in the civil-service sector. A happy ending, not least
because Hallers is rewarded with a bourgeois girl as well.
However, the exponential burglar, who invades both the personality
and the villa of the lawyer, loves not the bourgeois girl but rather her
maid (or stenotypist, had Lindau written a couple of years later), who
was let go for disgraceful behavior. The civil-service domain of 1900
dreams, in terms criminal and erotic, male and female, of all its underbel­
lies and doppelgangers. This dream, however, resides precisely in the mid­
dle ground between film and anthropometries. The only indication that
both sides of Hallers's double life are relayed is a photograph of the wait­
ress Amalie. He receives the photograph as a criminal and finds it again,
having changed back into the prosecutor, in his jacket pocket, at which
point he can (following Bertillon) identify the woman he worships at
night. But this photo materializes in the imaginary, even before the first
transformation, during Feldermann's diagnosis.
Feldermann. Are your dreaming at all?
HaIlers. Yes
Feldermann. Of what?
HaIlers (reluctantly). Of uncomfortable things. I feel as if my dreams ap­
peared in a kind of sequence, as if I returned to the
same haunts every once in a while.
Feldermann. What haunts are you talking about?
Hallers. I can't recall the details. (More quietly.) I always
see . . . something reddish . . . the gleam of a light . . .Film

Film projection as internal theater exists two years prior to its intro­
duction. Reason enough for Lindau, the writer, to forsake writing for cin­
ema as quickly as possible. As with Freud or Rank, dreams are films and
vice versa. One only has to have a nervous disorder like HaIlers's to trig­
ger the shutter while dreaming instead of surrendering to the " shadowy,
fleeting . . . scenes of the film drama" and making literature again, as
does Rank. Madness is cinematographic not only in motoric and phys­
iognomic terms; cinema implements its psychic mechanisms itself.
That was precisely Miinsterberg's insight. The Photoplay: A Psycho­
logical Study, the slender, revolutionary, and forgotten theory of the fea­
ture film, was published in New York in 19 16. While psychiatrists contin­
ued to concentrate on pathologies of motion and psychoanalysts continued
to consume films and retranslate them into books, the director of the Har­
vard Psychological Laboratory went past consumption and usage. His
American fame opened the New York studios to him; hence he could ar­
gue both from the producer's standpoint and from the elementary level that
relates film and the central nervous system. That is the whole difference be­
tween Rank and Miinsterberg, psychoanalysis and psychotechnology.
Psychotechnology, a neologism coined by Miinsterberg, describes theI 60
Film
science of the soul as an experimental setup. Basics of Psychotechnology,
published in I9 I4, reframes in 700 pages the collected results of experi­
mental psychology in terms of their feasibility. What began the pioneer­
ing work of Wundt in Leipzig and what brought Miinsterberg to Cam­
bridge, Massachusetts, was the insight (dispelling presumptions in elitist
labs to the contrary) that everyday reality itself, from the workplace to
leisure time, has long been a lab in its own right. Since the motor and sen­
sory activities of so-called Man (hearing, speaking, reading, writing) have
been measured under all conceivable extreme conditions, their ergonomic
revolution is only a matter of course. The second industrial revolution en­
ters the knowledge base. Psychotechnology relays psychology and media
technology under the pretext that each psychic apparatus is also a tech­
nological one, and vice versa. Miinsterberg made history with studies on
assembly-line work, office data management, combat training.
Hence his theory was fully absorbed by the film studios (which had
not yet migrated to Hollywood). From film technology and film tricks,
knowledge only extracted what it had invested in the studies of optical il­
lusions since Faraday. With the indirect consequence that film technology
itself (as with phonography in Guyau's case) became a model of the soul­
initially as philosophy and, eventually, as psychotechnology.
In I907, Bergson's Creative Evolution culminated in the claim that
the philosophically elementary functions of "perception, intellection, lan­
guage" all fail to comprehend the process of becoming. " Whether we
would think becoming, or express it, or even perceive it, we hardly do
anything else than set going a kind of cinematograph inside us. We may
therefore sum up what we have been saying in the conclusion that the
mechanism of our ordinary knowledge is of a cinematographical kind."
Instead of registering change as such, "we take snapshots, as it were, of
the passing reality, " which-once it is "recomposed . . . artificially," like
a film-yields the illusion of movement. 154 What that means in concrete
physiological terms is beyond the philosopher Bergson, who is solely in­
terested that film mark a historical difference: In antiquity, "time com­
prises as many undivided periods as our natural perception and our
language cut out in it successive facts. " By contrast, modern science, as if
Muybridge were its founding hero, isolates (following the model of
differential equations) the most minute time differentials. "It puts them
all in the same rank, and thus the gallop of a horse spreads out for it
into as many successive attitudes as it wishes," rather than (as " on the
frieze of the Parthenon" ) "massing itself into a single attitude, which isFilm
r6r
supposed to flash out i n a privileged moment and illuminate a whole
period." 155
Bergson does not want to reverse this panning shot from art to me­
dia, but his philosophy of life does envision a kind of knowledge that
could register becoming itself, independent of antique and modern tech­
nologies of perception: the redemption of the soul from its cinemato­
graphic illusion.
Psychotechnology proceeds exactly the other way around. For Miin­
sterberg, a sequence of stills, that is, Bergson's cinematographic illusion of
consciousness, is by no means capable of evoking the impression of move­
ment. Afterimages and the stroboscopic effect by themselves are necessary
but insufficient conditions for film. Rather, a series of experimental and
Gestalt-psychological findings demonstrates-contra Bergson-that the
perception of movement takes place as "an independent experience." 156
The eye does not receive the impressions of true movement. It is only a suggestion
of movement, and the idea of motion is to a high degree the product of our own
reaction . . . . The theater has both depth and motion, without any subjective help;
the screen has them and yet lacks them. We see things distant and moving, but we
furnish to them more than we receive; we create the depth and the continuity
through our mental mechanism.1s7
One cannot define film more subjectively than Miinsterberg does, but
only to relay these subjective ideas to technology. Cinema is a psycholog­
ical experiment under conditions of everyday reality that uncovers un­
conscious processes of the central nervous system. Conversely, traditional
arts such as theater, which Miinsterberg (following Vachel Lindsay) 158
continuously cites as a counterexample, must presuppose an always-al­
ready functioning perception without playing with their mechanisms.
They are subject to the conditions of an external reality that they imitate:
"Space, time, causality. " 159 On the other hand, Miinsterberg's demonstra­
tion that the new medium is completely independent aesthetically and
need not imitate theater suggests that it assembles reality from psycho­
logical mechanisms. Rather than being an imitation, film plays through
what "attention, memory, imagination, and emotion " perform as uncon­
scious acts. 160 For the first time in the global history of art, a medium in­
stantiates the neurological flow of data. Although the arts have processed
the orders of the symbolic or the orders of things, film presents its spec­
tators with their own processes of perception-and with a precision that
is otherwise accessible only to experiment and thus neither to conscious­
ness nor to language.1 62
Film
Miinsterberg's errand to the film studios was worth it. His psy­
chotechnology, instead of merely assuming similarities between film and
dreams as does psychoanalysis, can ascribe a film trick to each individual,
unconscious mechanism. Attention, memory, imagination, emotion: they
all have their technological correlative.
Naturally, this analysis begins with attention, because in the age of
media facts are generally defined by their signal-to-noise ratio. "The
chaos of the surrounding impressions is organized into a real cosmos of
experience by our selection, " 161 which, in turn, can either be voluntary or
involuntary. But because voluntary selection would separate spectators
from the spell of the medium, it is not considered. What counts is solely
whether and how the different arts control involuntary attention and
hence "play on the keyboard of our mind. " 1 62 Of
the whole large scene, we see only the fingers of the hero clutching the revolver
with which he is to commit the crime. Our attention is entirely given up to the
passionate play of his hand . . . . Everything else sinks into a general vague back­
ground, while that one hand shows more and more details. The more we fixate
[on] it, the more its clearness and distinctness increase. From this one point wells
our emotion, and our emotion again concentrates our senses on this one point. It
is as if this one hand were during this pulse beat of events the whole scene, and
everything else had faded away. On the stage this is impossible; there nothing can
fade away. That dramatic hand must remain, after all, only the ten thousandth
part of the space of the whole stage; it must remain a little detail. The whole body
of the hero and the other men and the whole room and every indifferent chair and
table in it must go on obtruding themselves on our senses. What we do not attend
cannot be suddenly removed from the stage. Every change which is needed must
be secured by our own mind. In our consciousness the attended hand must grow
and the surrounding room must blur. But the stage cannot help us. The art of the
theater has there its limits.
Here begins the art of the photoplay. That one nervous hand which feverishly
grasps the deadly weapon can suddenly for the space of a breath or two become
enlarged and be alone visible on the screen, while everything else has really faded
into darkness. The act of attention which goes on in our mind has remodeled the
surrounding itself . . . . In the language of the photoplay producer it is a "close­
up. " The close-up has objectified in our world of perception our mental act of at­
tention and by it has furnished art with a means which far transcends the power
of any theater stage.163
Miinsterberg's patient gaze, which we have long since unlearned,
focuses not for nothing on the revolver: its drum stands at the origin of
cinema. When it appears as a close-up, film films involuntary and tech­
nological mechanisms at the same time. Close-ups are not just "objec-Film
I 63
tivizations" of attention; attention itself appears as the interface of an
apparatus.
This is true of all the involuntary mechanisms Miinsterberg investi­
gates. Whereas each of the temporal arts, in "the most trivial case," pre­
supposes the storage of past events, "the theater can do no more than
suggest to our memory this looking backward"-namely, with words, for
which " our own material of memory ideas" must "supply the pic­
ture [sJ . " 164 In the "slang" and practice of photo artists, by contrast, there
are cut-backs or flashbacks, which are "really an objectivation of our
memory function. " 165 The same is true of the imagination as unconscious
expectation and of associations in general. Aside from flashbacks and
flash-forwards, cinematic montage conquers "the whole manifoldness of
parallel currents with their endless interconnections. " 166 According to the
film theory of Bela Balazs, who unknowingly furthered Miinsterberg's
work, unconscious processes "can never be rendered so visually in words
as in cinematic montage -be they the words of a physician or a poet. Pri­
marily because the rhythm of montage can reproduce the original speed
of the process of association. (Reading a description takes much longer
than the perception of an image ) . " 167
And yet, literature-whose power film infinitely exceeds or "tran­
scends," according to Miinsterberg-attempts the impossible. Schnitzler's
novellas simulate processes of association in phonographic real time,168
Meyrink's novels in filmic real time. The Golem appears in I9 I 5 as a dop­
pelganger novel in ostensible competition with Ewers's and Lindau's suc­
cesses on the screen; as a simulation of film, however, it unknowingly an­
ticipates Miinsterberg's theory. Meyrink's framing narrative begins with
a nameless I, who is transformed by his half-asleep associations into the
doppelganger of the framed story. As if in a flashback, this person, Per­
nath, reappears in the Prague ghetto, long since torn down, only to en­
counter in turn a Golem who is expressly called Pernath's "negative, " 169
that is, the doppelganger of the doppelganger. This iteration of mirror sit­
uations, associations, transformations follows the techniques of film so
closely that Meyrink's framing narrative even sacrifices the time-honored
past tense of the novel to it. It is not just since Gravity's Rainbow that
novels have been written in the present tense to suggest the flow of asso­
ciation and easy filmability.
Which makes interpretation meaningless and only invites the rewrit­
ing of Meyrink's beginning as a screenplay. Well, here is the first chapter
(the narrative frame) of The Golem once more, this time in two columns
with Miinsterbergian instructions for the camera.r 64

SLEEP
The moonlight is falling on to the foot of my bed. It lies
there like a tremendous stone, flat and gleaming.
Fade-out to dream As the shape of the new moon begins to dwindle, and its
left side starts to wane-as age will treat a human face,
leaving his trace of wrinkles first upon one hollowing
cheek-my soul becomes a prey to vague unrest. It tor­
ments me.
r cannot sleep; r cannot wake; in its half dreaming state
my mind forms a curious compound of things it has
seen, things it has read, things it has heard-streams,
each with its own degree of clarity and color, that inter­
mingle, and penetrate my thought.
Before r went to bed, r had been reading from the life of
Buddha; one particular passage now seeks me out and
haunts me, drumming its phrases into my ears over and
over and over again from the beginning, in every possi­
ble permutation and combination:
Caption (text) "A crow flew down to a stone that looked, as it lay, like
a lump of fat.
Thought the crow, 'Here is a toothsome morsel for my
dining'; but finding it to be nothing of the kind, away it
flew again. So do we crows, having drawn near to the
stone, even so do we, would-be seekers after truth, aban­
don Gautama the Anchorite, so soon as in him we cease
to find our pleasure. "
Close-up ( attention) This image of the stone that resembled a lump of fat as­
sumes ever larger and larger proportions within my
brain.
Moving camera r am stumbling along the dried-up bed of a river, picking

up smoothed pebbles.
Close-ups Now they are grayish-blue, coated in a fine, sparkling
dust; persistently r grub them up in handfuls, without in
the least knowing what use r shall make of them; now
they are black, with sulfury spots, like the strivings of
a child to create in stone squab, spotty, prehistoric
monsters.
( involuntary attention) r strive with all my might and main to throw these
stone shapes from me, but always they drop out of my

hand, and, do what I will, are there, for ever there,
within my sight.
Cut-back (
=
involuntary memory) Whereupon every stone that my life has ever
contained seems to rise into existence and compass me
around.
Numbers of them labor painfully to raise themselves out
of the sand towards the light-like monstrous, slaty­
hued crayfish when the tide is at the full-and all rivet
their gaze upon me, as though agonizing to tell me tid­
ings of infinite importance.
Fading
Others, exhausted, fall back spent into their holes, as if
once for all abandoning their vain search for words.
Fade-out to everyday
Time and again do I start up from this dim twilight of
dreams, and for the reality space of a moment experience
once more the moonshine on the end of my billowing
counterpane, like a large, flat, bright stone, only to sink
blindly back into the realms of semi-consciousness, there
to grope and grope in my painful quest for that eternal
stone that in some mysterious fashion lurks in the dim
recesses of my memory in the guise of a lump of fat . . . .
What happens next I cannot say. Whether, of my own
free will, I abandon all resistance; whether they over­
power and stifle me, those thoughts of mine . . .
I only know that my body lies sleeping in its bed, while
my mind, no longer part of it, goes forth on its wander­
mgs.
Who am I? That is the question I am suddenly beset
with a desire to ask; but at the same instant do I become
conscious of the fact that I no longer possess any organ
to whom this query might be addressed; added to which,
I am in mortal terror lest that idiotic voice should
reawaken and begin all over again that never-ending
business of the stone and the lump of fat.
Fade-out (onto doppelganger) I capitulate.17o
The Golem begins as film; more precisely, as a silent film. Only films
make it possible to present all the mechanisms of madness, to run through
chains of associations in real time, and to jump continually from a
metaphoric stone at the bedside to a real stone in the ghetto of the dop­
pelganger. (Immediately after the capitulation of the "I," Pernath begins
his life history in the past tense as the I of the framed story. )1 66
Film
And only silent films command the robbing of the narrative I of all
its organs of speech. In lieu of reflexive introspections we have neurolog­
ically pure data flows that are always already films on the retina. All­
powerful optical hallucinations can flood and sever a body, and eventu­
ally make it into an other. Pernath and Golem, the substitutes of the nar­
rative I in the framed story, are the positive and negative of a celluloid
ghost.
Fading of consciousness itself . . . simply as a sequence of film tricks.
" Our psychic apparatus reveals itself in these transformations,"
wrote Balazs. "If fading, distorting, or copying could be executed with­
out any specific image, that is, if the technique could be divorced from
any particular object, then this 'technique as such' would represent the
mind as SUCh." 1 71
But as Munsterberg demonstrated, the transformation of a psychic
apparatus into film-trick transformations is lethal for the mind [Geist] as
such. Mathematical equations can be solved in either direction, and the
title "psychotechnology" already suggests that film theories based on ex­
perimental psychology are at the same time theories of the psyche (soul)
based on media technologies. In The Golem, Proust's beloved souvenir in­
volontaire becomes a flashback, attention a close-up, association a cut,
and so on. Involuntary mechanisms, which hitherto existed only in hu­
man experiments, bid their farewell to humans only to populate film stu­
dios as the doppelgangers of a deceased soul. One Golem as tripod or
muscles, one as celluloid or a retina, one as cut-back or random access
memory . . .
Golems, however, possess the level of intelligence of cruise missiles,
and not only those in Meyrink's novel or Wegener's film. They can be pro­
grammed with conditional jump instructions, that is, first to execute
everything conceivable and then to counter the danger of the infinite spi­
rals praised by Goethe. Precisely for that reason, in Munsterberg's succinct
words, "every dream becomes real" in film.172 All the historical attributes
of a subject who around 1 800 celebrated his or her authenticity under the
title literature can around 1900 be replaced or bypassed by Golems, these
programmed subjects. And above all, dreams as a poetic attribute.
The romantic novel par excellence, Novalis's Henry von Ofterdingen,
programmed the poetic calling of its hero with media-technological pre­
cision: as a library-inspired fantasy and a dream of words. As if by
chance, Ofterdingen was allowed to discover an illustrated manuscript
with neither name nor title, but which dealt "with the wondrous fortunes
of a poet." 173 Its pictures "seemed wonderfully familiar to him, and as heFilm
r 67
looked more sharply, he discovered a rather clear picture of himself
among the figures. He was startled and thought he was dreaming" 1 74-
the wonder of the dream was the necessity of the system. In r 80 r , the re­
cruitment of new authors was, after all, achieved through literarily vague
doppelgangers, in whom bibliophile readers could recognize (or not) their
similarly unrecordable " Gestalt. " And Ofterdingen promptly decided to
merge with the author and hero of the book he found.
This mix-up of speech and dream was programmed at the novel's be­
ginning. There Ofterdingen listened to the "stories " of a stranger that told
of "the blue flower" that nobody had ever seen or heard of. But because
prospective writers needed to be able to change words into optical­
acoustic hallucinations, Ofterdingen quickly fell asleep and began dream­
ing. Poetic wonder did not wait: words became an image, and the image
a subject, Ofterdingen's future beloved.
But what attracted him with great force [in the dream) was a tall, pale blue
flower, which stood beside the spring and touched him with its broad glistening
leaves. Around this flower were countless others of every hue, and the most deli­
cious fragrance filled the air. He saw nothing but the blue flower and gazed upon
it long with inexpressible tenderness. Finally, when he wanted to approach the
flower, it all at once began to move and change; the leaves became more glistening
and cuddled up to the growing stem; the flower leaned towards him and its petals
displayed an expanded blue corolla wherein a delicate face hoveredYs
No word, no book, no writer can write what women are. That is why
that task was performed during the age of Goethe by poetic dreams,
which, with the help of psychotricks, produced an ideal woman and
hence a writer from the word "flower. " The trick film (following Miin­
sterberg's insight) makes such internal theater of subjects or literate peo­
ple as perfect as it is superfluous.
No theater could ever try to match such wonders, but for the camera they are not
difficult . . . . Rich artistic effects have been secured, and while on the stage every
fair play is clumsy and hardly able to create an illusion, in the film we see the man
transformed into a beast and the flower into a girl. There is no limit to the trick
pictures which the skill of the experts invents. The divers jump, feet first, out of
the water to the springboard. It looks magical, and yet the camera man has sim­
ply to reverse his film and to run it from the end to the beginning of the action.
Every dream becomes real.176
A medium that turns moonspots into stones or, better still, flowers
into girls no longer allows for any psychology. The same machinelike per­
fection can make flowers into a so-called I. That is precisely the claim of1 68

Lacan's scheme of the inverted vase. (From Lacan 198 8a, 1 39; reproduced by
permission of W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. © 1975 by Les Editions du Seuil;
English translation © 198 8 by Cambridge University Press)
Lacan's theory, which, especially as an anti-psychology, is up to date with
contemporary technological developments. The symbolic of letters and
numbers, once celebrated as the highest creation of authors or geniuses: a
world of computing machines. The real in its random series, once the sub­
ject of philosophical statements or even "knowledge" : an impossibility
that only signal processors ( and psychoanalysts of the future) can bring
under their control. Finally, the imaginary, once the dream produced by
and coming out of the caverns of the soul: a simple optical trick.
In The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud followed the positivistic
"suggestion that we should picture the instrument which carries out our
mental functions as resembling a compound microscope or a photo­
graphic apparatus, or something of the kind." 177 Lacan's theory of the
imaginary is an attempt truly to "materialize" 178 such models. As a result
of which, cinema-the repressed of Freud's year at the Salpetriere-re­
turns to psychoanalysis. Lacan's optical apparatuses show a complexity
that can only derive from cinematic tricks. Step by step, they go beyond
the simple mirror and the (mis)recognition that induces in the small child
a first but treacherous image of sensory-motoric wholeness.
Following Bouasse's Photometrie of 1934, a concave mirror initially
projects the real image of a hidden vase into the same room where, in be­
tween x and y, it is expected by its actual flowers. If the optic beams com-Film

ing out of the parabola, however, are also deflected by a plane mirror per­
pendicular to the eye, then the vase, miraculously filled with flowers, ap­
pears to the subject S next to its own, but only virtual, mirror image VS.
"That is what happens in man, " who first achieves "the organization of
the totality of reality into a limited number of preformed networks" 179
and then lives through his identification with virtual doppelgangers. Nar­
cissism is duplicated.
Lacan, however, did not need to search for his optical tricks in the
science of Bouasse. Film pioneers, who have always been dreaming of
3 -D cinema without glasses, built apparatuses of a similar nature. In 19 10
Oskar Messter, the founder of the German film industry and the person
in charge of all photography and film footage taken at the front during
the First World War,180 introduced his Alabastra Theater in Berlin. He re­
placed the concave mirror of Bouasse and Lacan with a film projector C1 70
Film
that nevertheless had the same function as the mirror: his lenses projected
real images of actors that were allowed to act only against the black back­
ground of all media-on a screen E located below the stage A. The audi­
ence, however, only saw the virtual image of this screen, projected by the
plane mirror B. With the result that filmed female dancers appeared on
the stage of the Alabastra Theater itself and gave the impression of mov­
ing through three dimensions. l S I
"Hence," Lacan said, addressing his seminar participants as well as
the audience of the Alabastra Theater, "you are infinitely more than you
can imagine, subjects [or underlings] of gadgets and instruments of all
kinds-ranging from the microscope to radio and television-that will
become elements of your being." l S2
What's missing now is for the plane mirror B to become a psychoan­
alyst and, prompted by the remote control of language that occupies
him,183 turn by 90 degrees, so that the subject S sacrifices all its imaginary
doppelgangers to the symbolic. Then, three dimensions or media-the
nothing called a rose, the illusion of cinema, and discourse-will have
been separated in a technologically pure way. The end of psychoanaly­
sis/es is depersonalization.ls4
Consequently, Lacan was the first (and last) writer whose book titles
only described positions in the media system. The writings were called
Writings, the seminars, Seminar, the radio interview, Radiophonie, and
the TV broadcast, Television.
Media-technological differentiations opened up the possibility for media
links. After the storage capacities for optics, acoustics, and writing had
been separated, mechanized, and extensively utilized, their distinct data
flows could also be reunited. Physiologically broken down into fragments
and physically reconstructed, the central nervous system was resurrected,
but as a Golem made of Golems.
Such recombinations became possible no later than the First World
War, when media technologies, reaching beyond information storage, be­
gan to affect the very transmission of information. Sound film combined
the storage of acoustics and optics; shortly thereafter, television combined
their transmission. Meanwhile, the text storage apparatus of the type­
writer remained an invisible presence, that is to say, in the bureaucratic
background. Lacan's final seminars all revolve around possibilities of con­
necting and coupling the real, the symbolic, and the imaginary.
Engineers, however, had been planning media links all along. Since
everything from sound to light is a wave or a frequency in a quantifiable,Film
171
nonhuman time, signal processing i s independent o f any one single
medium. Edison perceived this very clearly when he described the de­
velopment of his kinetoscope in 1 894: "In the year 1 8 8 7, the idea oc­
curred to me that it was possible to devise an instrument which should do
for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear, and that by a combi­
nation of the two all motion and sound could be recorded and reproduced
simultaneously. " 185
Cinema as an add-on to the phonograph-in theory, this applied only
to storage and not to the systemic differences between one- and two-di­
mensional signal processing; in practice, however, the analogy had far­
reaching implications. Edison's Black Mary, the very first film studio, si­
multaneously recorded sound and motion, that is, phonographic and
kinetographic traces. In other words, sound film preceded silent film. But
the synchronization of data streams remained a problem. Whereas in the
optical realm, processing was a matter of equidistant scanning, which
television was to increase to millions of points per second, in the acoustic
dimension processing was based on analogies in a continuous stream of
time. As a result, there arose synchronization problems similar to those of
goose-stepping French regiments, problems more difficult to amend than
Demeny's. Which is why Edison's master-slave relationship was turned on
its head, and film, with its controllable time, took the lead. Mass-media
research, with stacks of books on film and hardly any on gramophony,
followed in its wake.
But pure silent film hardly ever existed. Wherever media were unable
to connect, human interfaces filled the niche. Acoustic accompaniment in
the shape of words and music came out of every fairground, variety
show, and circus corner. Wagner pieces like the Liebestod or the "Ride of
the Valkyries " posthumously proved that they had been composed as
sound tracks. At first, solo piano or harmonium players fought for image­
sound synchronicity in movie houses; from 1910 on, so did entire ensem­
bles in urban centers. When the literati Diiubler, Pinthus, Werfel, Hasen­
clever, Ehrenstein, Zech, and Lasker-Schuler saw The Adventures of
Lady Glane in Dessau in 19 1 3 , the "dismal background piano clinking"
was "drowned out by the voice of a narrator commenting on the action
in a broad Saxon: 'And 'ere on a dark and stormy night we see Lady
Glahney . . . "' 1 86 The repulsion in the progressive literati triggered by the
Saxon dialect gave rise to their Movie Book . It " incited extensive and far­
reaching discussions about the misguided ambitions of the newly emerg­
ing silent film to imitate the word- or stage-centered theatrical drama or
the ways in which novels use narrative language instead of probing the172
Film
new and infinite possibilities inherent in moving images, and [Pinthus]
raised the question what each of us, if asked to write a script, would
come up with. " 187
Pinthus et al. thus turned the handicaps of contemporary technology
into aesthetics. Sound, language, and even intertitles were all but purged
from the literary scripts they (rather unsuccessfully) offered to the film in­
dustry. For the medium of silent film as for the writing medium, the guid­
ing motto was appropriateness of material. (The fact that the Movie Book
itself linked the two was missed by Pinthus.) As if the differentiation of
distinct storage media had called for theoretical overdetermination, early
film analyses all stressed l' art pour l' art for the silent film. According to
Bloem, "the removal of silence would dissolve the last and most impor­
tant barrier protecting films from their complete subjugation to the de­
piction of plain reality. An utterly unbridled realism would crush any re­
maining touch of stylization that yet characterizes even the most impov­
erished film. "188 Even Miinsterberg's psychotechnology discerned
insoluble aesthetic rather than mechanical problems in the media link of
film and phonograph.
A photoplay cannot gain but only lose if its visual purity is destroyed. If we see
and hear at the same time, we do indeed come nearer to the real theatre, but this
is desirable only if it is our goal to imitate the stage. Yet if that were the goal, even
the best imitation would remain far inferior to an actual theatre performance. As
soon as we have clearly understood that the photoplay is an art in itself, the con­
versation of the spoken word is as disturbing as colour would be on the clothing
of a marble statue. 189
The "invention of the sound film came down like a landslide" on
these theories. In 1930, at the end of the silent film era, Balazs saw "a
whole rich culture of visual expression in danger. " 1 9o The International
Artists Lodge as well as the Association of German Musicians, the human
interfaces of the silent movie palaces, agreed and went even further in
their labor dispute, turning Miinsterberg's arguments into a pamphlet
"To the Audience! " : "Sound film is badly conserved theater at a higher
price! " 191
Literature as word art, theater as theater, film as the filmic and radio
as the radiophonic: all these catchwords of the 1920S were defensive mea­
sures against the approaching media links. "A voluntary restriction of the
artist to the technical material at hand-that results in the objective and
immutable stylistic laws of his art." l92 In strict accordance with Mal­
larmes model, the filmic and the radiogenic were to import ['art pour ['artFilm
173
into the optical and acoustic realms. But the radiogenic art o f the radio
play was not killed off by the mass-media link of television; already at its
birth it was not as wholly independent of the optical as the principle of
appropriate material demanded. With its "accelerated dreamlike succes­
sion of colorful and rapidly passing, jumping images, its abbreviations
and superimpositions-its speed-its change from close-up to long shot
with fade-in, fade-out, fade-over, " the early radio play "consciously
transferred film technology to radio. " 193
The reverse passage from sound to image, or from gramophone to
film, was taken less consciously, maybe even unconsciously. But only once
records emanate from their electric transmission medium of radio does
the rayon girl decide to "write her life like a movie. " In Bronnen's Holly­
wood novel, Barbara La Marr learns from the record player all the move­
ments that will make her a movie star. " We have a gramophone, that's all.
Sometimes I dance to it. But that is all I know about large cities and
singers and variety shows, of movies and Hollywood. " 194 In turn, the
gramophone (and some jazz bands) felt compelled to technologically syn­
chronize a woman's body: while making love,195 inventing the strip
tease,l96 taking screen tests,197 and so on. The future movie star Barbara
La Marr was acoustically preprogrammed.
Two entertainment writers with Nobel prizes, Hermann Hesse and
Thomas Mann, followed the beaten track. Immediately prior to the in­
troduction of sound film, links connecting cinema and gramophone, espe­
cially when they stayed in the realm of the fantastic, were the best adver­
tisement. Hesse's Steppenwolf culminates in a "Magic Theater, " evidently
the educated circumscription of a movie theater that uses radio records to
produce its optical hallucination. From the "pale cool shimmer" of an
"ear" that, as with Bell and Clarke's Ur-telephone, belongs to a corpse,
emerges the music of Handel in "a mixture of bronchial slime and chewed
rubber; that noise that owners of gramophones and radios have agreed to
call radio. " But it is precisely this music that conjures up an optically hal­
lucinated Mozart whose interpretation of Handel's music encourages con­
sumers to perceive the latter's everlasting value behind the medium.198
The stage is set for sound tracks.
Thomas Mann could already look back on one film version of Bud­
denbrooks when a "very good Berlin producer" approached him in 1927
with plans for turning The Magic Mountain into a movie. Which was
"not surprising" to Mann. Ever since December 28, 1 895, when the Lu­
mieres presented their cinema projector, non-filmability has been an un­
mistakable criterion for literature. " What might not have been made" of1 74
Film
entertainment novels, particularly of the "chapter 'Snow,' with its
Mediterranean dream of humanity! " 199 Dreams of humans and human­
ity, whether the results of meteorological snow or of the powder of the
same name, stage the mirror stage and are therefore cinema from the
start.200
The particular human in question, after escaping his dismemberment,
embarks on a career in a lung sanatorium. The Magic Mountain already
has at its disposal a stereoscope, a kaleidoscope, and, though demoted to
the status of an amusing diversion, Marey's cinematographic cylinder.201
In the end, however, and shortly before the First World War and its
trenches, the so-called engineer Castorp also receives a modern Polyhym­
nia gramophone, which he proceeds to administer as "an overflowing cor­
nucopia of artistic enjoyment. " 202 Opportunities for self-advertisement
follow swiftly, even though pathology once again stands in for future
technology. The sanatorium's own psychoanalyst and spiritualist is un­
able to conjure up the spirit of Castorp's deceased cousin until the gramo­
phone administrator comes up with the obvious solution. Only when
prompted by the phonographic reproduction of his favorite tune does the
spirit appear,203 thus revealing this media link to be a sound-film repro­
duction. Nothing remains to keep The Magic Mountain from being made
into a movie.
Entertainment writers in particular, who insist on playing Goethe
even under advanced technological conditions,204 know fully well that
Goethe's "writing for girls"205 is no longer sufficient: the girls of the Magic
Mountain have deserted to the village movie theatre, their "ignorant red .
face[s] . . . twisted into an expression of the hugest enj oyment. "206
That, too, is a media link, but an ordinary and unassuming one be­
neath the dignity of Nobel Prize winners. Since 1 8 80, literature no longer
has been able to write for girls, simply because girls themselves write.
They are no longer taken by imagining sights and sounds between poetic
lines, for at night they are at the movies and during the day they sit at
their typewriters. Even the Magic Mountain has as its "business center"
a "neat little office" with "a typist busy at her machine."207
The media link of film and typewriter thoroughly excludes literature.
In 1929, the editor and German Communist Party member Rudolf Braune
published a miscellany on the empirical sociology of readers in the litera­
ture section of the Frankfurter Zeitung. Pursuing the question "What
They Read, " Braune had approached "Three Stenographers" and re­
ceived answers that triggered his public outcry: Colette, Ganghofer, Edgar
Wallace, Hermann Hesse . . . Not even Braune's desperate attempt to in-Film
175
terest the three office workers i n literature loyal to the party line met with
success. Five weeks later, however, on May 26, 1929, the typists received
a boost. Nameless female colleagues wrote or typed letters to the editors
and readers of the Frankfurter Zeitung, informing them what is different
about modern women:
If we stenographers read little or nothing, do you know why? Because at night we
are much too tired and exhausted, because to us the rattling of the typewriters,
which we have to listen to for eight hours, keeps ringing in our ears throughout
the evening, because each word we hear or read breaks down into letters four
hours later. That is why we cannot spend evenings other than at the movies or go­
ing for walks with our inevitable friend. 20s
Whereas social engagement queries the reception or non-reception of lit­
erature in sociological terms, the test subjects respond in technological
terms. Typewriters that break down their input into single letters in order
to deliver an output in the shape of series and columns of standardized
block letters also determine historical modes of reception. As selective as
a band-pass filter, the machine positions itself between books and
speeches on the one hand and eyes or even ears on the other. As a result,
language does not store or transmit any meaning whatsoever for stenog­
raphers, only the indigestible materiality of the medium it happens to be.
Every night the movie-continuum has to treat the wounds that a discrete
machine inflicts upon secretaries during the day. An entanglement of the
imaginary and the symbolic. The new media link that excludes literature
was nevertheless committed to paper: in the shape of a screenplay that
was never filmed. Pinthus's Movie Book printed plain text on cinema,
books, and typewriters.
R I C HARD A . B E RMANN, " LYRE AND TYPEWRITER " ( 19 1 3 )
Returning home from her beloved movies, a swarthy little typist should tell
her smiling friend about a movie thus:
Now there's a movie that clearly shows how important we typists are­
we who copy and sometimes also occasion your poems. You see, first they
showed what you poets are like when we're not around. One of you-with
long hair and big tie, lots of attitude for no reason-he's sitting at home
chewing on a huge pen. Maybe he's got nothing to eat, and why should he?
Is he working? He nervously runs around the room. He writes a verse on aFilm
176
piece of paper folded in a funny way. He stands in front of the mirror, re­
cites the verse, and admires himself. In a very satisfied mood, he lies down
on the sofa. He gets up again and goes on chewing-he can think of ab­
solutely nothing. Angrily he rips up the piece of paper. You can tell he feels
ignored because he doesn't get anything done. He puts on a romantic coat
and hurries to a literary cafe. It's summer, so he can sit outside on the street.
Then
she walks
by-a very blond energetic muse. He quickly calls the
waiter and with great ado does not pay for the melange. He hurries after
the muse. She takes the tube. As luck has it he's got ten cents left, so he
takes a ride too. He approaches her when she leaves the station, but she's
not one of those and sends him packing. Well, he still follows her. She enters
her house, grabs the elevator key, and takes a ride upstairs. He runs up the
stairs like a madman and arrives just as she closes her door. But there's a
sign on the door:
MINNIE TIPP
Typing Service
Transcription of Literary Works
Dictation
He rings the bell. The door opens. Minnie Tipp is already typing away. She
wants to throw him out but he claims to be a customer with a dictation. He
assumes a pose and dictates: " Miss, I love you! " She types it and the writing
appears on the white screen. But she throws the scrap of paper at his feet,
sits down again, and writes: "I have no time for idle sluggards. Come back
when you have some literary work that needs copying. Goodbye! "
Like, what can he d o in the face o f s o much virtue ? He goes back home
really dejected and despairs in front of the mirror. He gets paper, lots of
paper, and plans to write like there's no tomorrow. But he can't do any more
than chew the pen, which by now is quite short. He reclines on his infamous
sofa. Suddenly, the image of Minnie appears-the upright, diligent, ener­
getic typist. She shows him a perfectly typed page that reads: "I would love
you, too, if you could get some real work done ! " The image vanishes and he
returns to his desk. And now, you see, the boy with bow and quiver appears
in a dark corner of the room. He darts to the desk at which the brooding
poet is sitting and pours a quiver full of ink into his sterile inkwell. Then the
boy sits down with crossed legs on the sofa and watches. The poet dips his
pen-now it's running all by itself. As soon as the pen touches the paper, it
is full of the most beautiful verses and whisked away. In no time the room is
full of manuscripts. The poet may dictate after all. They are all love poems.
The first one starts:Film
177
When first r beheld your eyes so blue
My limbs were filled with molten ore.
r work, and working am so close to you­
r live once more!
She writes with long sharp fingers, but she doesn't look at the machine and
leaves no spaces between the words. She is dancing a dance of love on her
machine. It is a mute duet. He is a very happy lyric poet. He returns home
in a rapture.
A couple of days later a man appears with a wheelbarrow and brings
the poet a couple of hundred pounds of perfectly copied manuscripts. He
also has a letter-a perfumed, neatly typed one. The poet kisses the letter.
He opens it. The boy with the bow is back in the room again and peers over
the poet's shoulder. But alas! The poet is tearing his hair-and the nice boy
pulls a face, for the letter reads:
Dear Sir, you will be receiving your manuscripts with today's mail. Please
allow me to inform you that r am enraptured by the fire of your verses. r also
beg to draw your attention to the enclosed invoice of 200 Marks. r would be de­
lighted if you were to communicate the amount to me in person, at which point
we could enter into a discussion concerning the content of your verses. Yours,
Minnie Tipp.
"That's what happens," the swarthy little typist tells her smiling friend,
"when we women are forced to work. It makes us so eminently practical."
Well, of course the poor poet hasn't a penny to his name. He searches
the whole room and finds only manuscripts. He searches his pockets and
finds only impressive holes. Amor wants to help and turns his quiver on its
head-but why would Amor walk around with two hundred Mark s ? Fi­
nally, there is nothing left for the poet to do but to get behind the wheelbar­
row and cart the manuscripts to a cheese dealer. He buys them to wrap soft
cow cheese. Now, the famous critic Fixfax is of a delicate nature and loves
runny cow cheese. S o he proceeds to the cheese dealer in person, buys a
portion, and takes it home. On the street pedestrians hold their noses and
bolt. But Fixfax loves smelling the cheese. As he is about to drill his nose ­
covered, of course, by bl � ck, horn-rimmed spectacles-into the cheese,
he happens to read a verse and is absolutely enchanted. He gets into a car
and drives straight to the publisher Solomon Edition and shows him the
cheese. The publisher can't stand the smell of cheese and writhes and
squirms. But the critic is all over him and quotes the poet's verses. Now the
publisher is enthusiastic, too. The two immediately run to the cheese dealer
and bring along a huge sack stuffed with an advance. ( " You have to know, "178
Film
the swarthy little typist tells her smiling friend, "this is a fantasy movie. " )
Well, the two buy all the cheese off the dealer, hire thirteen men who all
cover their noses, and proceed to the poet. The poet is standing on a chair
and about to hang himself, because he can't come up with the two hundred
Marks. A faint stench begins to pervade his room. Now, do you really hang
yourself when it's stinking so abominably? No, you get all angry and de­
velop a new zest for life. The thirteen guys march in but he throws them out
with such force that the cheese trickles down the stairs. He only quiets
down when the publisher and his sack full of money arrive. No stinking
cheese can match the fragrance of the advance.
The poet now hurries to the typing bureau. He finds this snotty busi­
nessman who is dictating snotty letters to Minnie and coming on to her. But
the poet throws him out; he can afford it, he can now afford to hire the typ­
ist for hours, days, and whole eternities. He immediately dictates another
poem to her. But what does she write ? " Stupid fellow! " she writes, " I love
the hardworking and successful. " Underlined twice. On that day they did
not type any further.
" It's a moral film," the swarthy little girl says. "It shows how an indus­
trious woman can educate a man."
For a moment, the friend no longer smiles. "It shows," he says, "how
an industrious woman ruins a man. The film will demonstrate to writers
that while this damned typewriter makes them diligent, it makes women
turn cold. The film will reveal the spiritual dangers of the typewriter. Do
you really think that poet's industrious manuscripts were any good? The
chewing and the sofa, that was good. But you professional women will
never understand that. "
The swarthy little one laughs.
And with good reason. While all the men of the time tragically collide
with their filmic doubles, the swarthy typist and her colleague Minnie
Tipp are united by serene harmony. Or, in more technical terms: by posi­
tive feedback. One woman goes to her beloved movies starring the other;
the plan was to make a movie featuring both. The logic of representation
would have been perfect: one and the same woman spends her days in the
real of work time and the symbolic of text processing, and her nights in a
technified mirror stage. Which is exactly how Braune's three stenotypists
described it.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Demeny speaks "Je
VOllS
ai-me" into the chronophotograph.1 80
Film
Against this film-within-a -film-within-a -film, this endless folding of
women and media, literature does not have a chance. Both men, the smil­
ing friend and his double, do not move beyond pens and poetry. Subse­
quently, they are left with an old-fashioned mirror stage in the shape of
ephemeral and unpublished authorship. You stare at empty white paper,
since Mallarme the background of all words, and fight with the sterility
Mallarme turned into a poem,209 until one lone verse finds its way onto
the paper. But not even the elementary consolation afforded by mirrors
that magically turn bodies into wholes and unconscious literates into self­
assured authors is of lasting value. The verse does not carry on into the
next; a hand tears up its handwriting, simply because it cannot do it with
the body itself.
Poets of 19 1 3 act in old-fashioned ways. One "stands in front of the
mirror, and recites the verse, and admires himself. " Twenty-two years af­
ter Demeny had replaced forgetful mirrors with trace detection and snap­
shots of speech, words are still lost: to declamations and torn paper. The
media revenge follows swiftly. When this particular poet upgrades his
mirror declamations to typed dictations, the most oral sentence of all falls
into technological storage and at the speaker's feet. And to top it off, the
typed "Miss, I love you! " appears on screen, published for the benefit of
all of Minnie Tipp's doubles.
Such is the solidarity of film and typewriter, Demeny and Miss Tipp.
Every word they hear, read, speak, or type breaks down (as the stenotyp­
ists put it) into its letters. The typist turns a poetic and erotically charged
flow of speech, the manifest secret of German literature, into twelve let­
ters, four empty spaces, and two punctuation marks, all of which (as her
correspondence makes clear) come with a price. Just as he had done with
"Vi-ve la Fran-ce ! " Demeny turns this declaration of love into twenty­
millisecond shots of his empty and media-infatuated mouth. He positions
himself in front of a camera (instead of the mirror), declaims the verse
of all verses, and becomes a test subject (instead of an admired author) .
"
JE VOUS AI-ME.
"
To the poetic intellect, the unassuming media link of silent film and
typewriter, image flow and intertitles, was nothing short of desecration.
In order to save the Soul of the Film, Bloem decreed: "Emotion does not
reside in the titles; it is not to be spoken, it is to be embodied mimic ally.
Yet there are directors who do not shy away from blaring out ' I love you'

words; therefore, silent films have to transfer them directly from type­
script to screen. In addition, Demeny's experiment delivered the grand
kaleidoscope of human speech, as Villiers would have put it, to the deaf
and dumb, and Minnie Tipp even delivered it to writers. The decomposi­
tion and filtering of love ensured that her new customer would rise to the
particular work ethic that characterizes "professional women" and marks
within that group a necessary, though not always sufficient, distinction
between typists and whores.211 With the result that a man, too, grasped
the secular difference between poet and writer. From handwriting to
typed dictation, from the loneliness in front of mirrors to the sexual divi­
sion of labor and best-selling poetry: as a "moral film, " "Lyre and Type­
writer" shows "how an industrious woman can educate a man." Or how,
in a fine animated sequence, the old snake becomes the Eve of the twen­
tieth century.

Film, the great media self-advertisement, has reached its target group and
its happy ending.TYPE WRITER
"Typewriter" is ambiguous. The word meant both typing machine and
female typist: in the United States, a source of countless cartoons. (Typed
letter of a bankrupt businessman to his wife: "Dear Blanche, I have sold
all my office furniture, chairs, desks, etc. etc., and I am writing this letter
under difficulties with my typewriter on my lap. " ) 1 But the convergence
of a profession, a machine, and a sex speaks the truth. Bermann's word
"stenotypist" gradually came to require footnotes explaining that since
1 8 8 5 , it has referred to women who have completed Ferdinand Schrey's
combined training program in the Hammond typewriter and stenography.
In the case of "typewriter, " by contrast, everyday language for once
matches statistics (see the accompanying table).
The table unfortunately does not distinguish between stenographic
handwriting and Remington's typewriting. Nevertheless, it is clear that
the statistical explosion begins in 1 8 8 1 , with the record sales of the Rem­
ington II. Although the number of men dwindles like a bell curve, the
number of female typists increases almost with the elegance of an expo­
nential function. As a consequence, it might be possible-as we approach
the threshold of infinity-to forecast the year in which typist and woman
converge. Minnie Tipp will have been Eve.
An innocuous device, "an 'intermediate' thing, between a tool and a
machine, " " almost quotidian and hence unnoticed, "2 has made history.
The typewriter cannot conjure up anything imaginary, as can cinema; it
cannot simulate the real, as can sound recording; it only inverts the gender
of writing. In so doing, however, it inverts the material basis of literature.
The monopoly of script in serial data processing was a privilege of
men. Because orders and poems were processed through the same chan­
nel, security protocols evolved. Even though more and more women were1 84

taught letters in the wake of general educational reform, being able to
read was not the same as being allowed to write. Prior to the invention of
the typewriter, all poets, secretaries, and typesetters were of the same sex.
As late as 1 8 5 9 , when the solidarity of American women's unions created
positions for female typesetters, their male colleagues on the presses
boycotted the printing of unmanly type fonts.3 Only the Civil War of
1 8 6 1- 6 4 that revolutionary media network of telegraph cables and par­
allel train tracks4-opened the bureaucracy of government, of mail and
stenography, to writing women; their numbers, of course, were as yet too
small to register statistically.
The Gutenberg Galaxy was thus a sexually closed feedback loop.
Even though Germanists are fundamentally oblivious to it, it controlled
nothing less than German literature. Unrecognized geniuses swung the
quill themselves, whereas national poets had personal secretaries, as in
the case of Goethe, John, Schuchardt, Eckermann, Riemer, and Geist. It is
precisely this media network-namely, that the Ur-author can bring forth
his spirit in Eckermann-that Professor Pschorr had been able to prove
phonographically in Goethe's study.s One's own or dictated script was
processed by male typesetters, binders, publishers, and so on, in order fi­
nally to reach in print the girls for whom Goethe wrote. As Goethe put it
in conversation with Riemer (who of course recorded it), "he conceives of
the Ideal in terms of female form or the form of Woman. What a man is,
he didn't know. " 6
Women could and had to remain an ideal abstraction, like Faust's
Gretchen, as long as the materialities of writing were the jobs of men, far
-1 86
Typewriter
too close for them to be aware of it. One Gretchen inspired the work; her
many sisters were allowed to consume it through their identification with
her. " Otherwise," that is, without sales and female readers, "things
would be bad" for him, the " author, " Friedrich Schlegel wrote to his
lover.7 But the honor of having a manuscript appear in print under the au­
thor's proper name was barred to women, if not factually then at least
media-technologically: the proper name at the head of their verse, novels,
and dramas almost always has been a male pseudonym.
If only because of that, an omnipresent metaphor equated women
with the white sheet of nature or virginity onto which a very male stylus
could then inscribe the glory of its authorship. No wonder that psycho­
analysis discovered during its clean-up operation that in dreams, " pencils,
pen-holders , . . and other instruments are undoubted male sexual sym­
bols." 8 It only retrieved a deeply embedded metaphysics of handwriting.
And consequently did not disclose any unconscious secrets, either.
For that, the "symbols " of man and woman were too closely attached to
the monopoly of writing. When, in 1 8 89 , the editors of the illustrated
journal Yom Pels zum Meer (as usual) made a pitch for Hammond type­
writers and Schrey, their general representative, the "writer of these lines"
was thrilled by a self-study: "Already after a couple of weeks he reached
a speed of 1 25 letters per minute. " Only two things were "lost" during
this mechanization of writing: first, "the intimacy of handwritten expres­
sion, which nobody is willing to relinquish voluntarily, particularly in per­
sonal correspondence" ; and second, a centerpiece of occidental symbolic
systems:
.
Machines everywhere, wherever one looks! A substitute for numerous types of la­
bor, which man would otherwise do with his industrious hand, and what econ­
omy of exertion and time, and what advantages in terms of flawlessness and reg­
ularity of work. It was only natural that after the engineer had deprived woman's
tender hand of the actual symbol of female industriousness, one of his colleagues
hit upon the idea of replacing the quill, the actual symbol of male intellectual ac­
tivity, with a machine.9
The literal meaning of text is tissue. Therefore, prior to their indus­
trialization the two sexes occupied strictly symmetrical roles: women,
with the symbol of female industriousness in their hands, wove tissues;
men, with the symbol of male intellectual activity in their hands, wove tis­
sues of a different sort called text. Here, the stylus as singular needle­
point, there, the many female readers as fabric onto which it wrote.
Industrialization simultaneously nullified handwriting and hand-Typewriter

based work. Not coincidentally, it was William K . Jenne, the head of the
sewing-machine subdivision of Remington & Son, who in 1 874 devel­
oped Sholes's prototype into a mass-producible "Type-Writer. " 10 Not co­
incidentally as well, early competing models came from the Domestic
Sewing Machine Co., the Meteor Saxon Knitting-Machine Factory, or
Seidel & NaumannY Bipolar sexual differentiation, with its defining
symbols, disappeared on industrial assembly lines. Two symbols do not
survive their replacement by machines, that is, their implementation in
the real. When men are deprived of the quill and women of the needle, all
hands are up for grabs-as employable as employees. Typescript amounts
to the desexualization of writing, sacrificing its metaphysics and turning it
into word processing.
A transvaluation of all values, even if it arrived on pigeon toes, as
Nietzsche would have it, or on "high-buttoned shoes" (in the words of
the most amusing chronicler of the typewriter) .12 To mechanize writing,
our culture had to redefine its values or (as the first German monograph
on the typewriter put it, in anticipation of Foucault) "create a wholly new
order of things. " 1 3 The work of ingenious tinkerers was far from achiev­
ing that. In 1 7 1 4 Henry Mill, an engineer with the New River Water Co.
in London, received his inconsequential British patent (no. 395 ) "for 'a
machine or artificial method, to print letters continuously one after an­
other while writing, in a fashion so clean and precise that they are indis­
tinguishable from the printing of letters.'" 14 The precision of this concept
or premise, namely, to introduce Gutenberg'S reproductive technology
into textual production, was contradicted by the vagueness of the patent's
phrasing. The work of Kempelen, the engineer of phonographs, to design
an appropriate writing instrument for a blind duchess was similarly in­
consequential. Under the discursive conditions of the age of Goethe, the
term "writing-machine " was bound to remain a non-term, as was proven
rather involuntarily by another Viennese.
In 1 8 2 3 , the physician C. L. Muller published a treatise entitled
Newly Invented Writing-Machine, with Which Everybody Can Write,
Without Light, in Every Language, and Regardless of One's Handwrit­
ing; Generate Essays and Bills; the Blind, Too, Can, Unlike with Previous
Writing Tablets, Write Not Only with Greater Ease but Even Read Their
Own Writing Afterward. What Muller meant and introduced was a me­
chanical contraption that, its name notwithstanding, only enabled the
blind to guide their hands across paper while writing. The mapping of the
page and the concentration of ink even afforded them the possibility of
rereading their writing through touch. For Muller could "not deny" an188
Typewriter
authorial narcissism that prompts " all those so inclined, " like Minnie
Tipp's poet, "to reread what he has written. " IS Significantly enough, the
invention was aimed primarily at educated but unfortunately blind fa­
thers for the purpose of illuminating their morally blind sons with letters
and epistolary truths. "How often would a man of good standing write a
few lines to save a lost estate or the welfare of whole families, how often
would the handwritten letter of a father steer a son back on the right
track, if such men could, without restraint and prompting, write in such a
way as if they had been endowed with vision. " 16
The "writing-machine," in that sense, only brought to light the rules
regulating discourses during the age of Goethe: authority and authorship,
handwriting and rereading, the narcissism of creation and reader obedi­
ence. The device for "everybody" forgot women.
Mechanical storage technologies for writing, images, and sound
could only be developed following the collapse of this system. The hard
science of physiology did away with the psychological conception that
guaranteed humans that they could find their souls through handwriting
and rereading. The "I think, " which since Kant was supposed to accom­
pany all of one's representations, presumably only accompanied one's
readings. It became obsolete as soon as body and soul advanced to be­
come obj ects of scientific experiments. The unity of apperception disinte­
grated into a large number of subroutines, which, as such, physiologists
could localize in different centers of the brain and engineers could recon­
struct in multiple machines. Which is what the "spirit"-the unsimulable
center of "man"-denied by its very definition.
Psychophysics and psychotechnology converted into empirical re­
search programs Nietzsche's philosophical and scandalous surmise that
"humans are perhaps only thinking, writing, and speaking machines."
Dysfunctional Speech (Die Storungen der Sprache), following KuRmaul's
insight or monograph of 1 8 8 1 , could only be cleared up under the
premise that speech has nothing to do with the "I think" :
One can conceive o f language in its initial development as a conditioned reflex. It
is the character of reflected intentionality that distinguishes conditioned from in­
born movements of expression, their greater ability to adapt, in appropriate form
and degree, to the intended purpose. Because of this quality, we are not quite pre­
pared to see in them anything but the play of mechanical circuits acquired
through exercise. And yet, pantomime, the spoken word, and the written word
are nothing but the products of internal, self-regulating mechanisms that are
channeled and coordinated through emotions and conceptions, just as one can op­
erate a sewing, typing, or speaking machine without knowing its mechanismYTypewriter
r 89
When, from the point of view of brain physiology, language works as
a feedback loop of mechanical relays, the construction of typewriters is
only a matter of course. Nature, the most pitiless experimenter, paralyzes
certain parts of the brain through strokes and bullet wounds to the head;
research (since the Battle of Solferino in r 8 5 9 ) is only required to mea­
sure the resulting interferences in order to distinguish the distinct subrou­
tines of speech in anatomically precise ways. Sensory aphasia (while hear­
ing), dyslexia (while reading), expressive aphasia (while speaking),
agraphia (while writing) bring forth machines in the brain. KufSmaul's
"sound board," with its "cortical sound keys," 18 virtually conjures up the
rods and levers of old Remingtons.
Disabilities or deformations therefore suggest not only Muller's
"sweet hope" to be "of use to his fellow humans" and "to alleviate the
suffering of many unfortunates. " 19 Blindness and deafness, precisely
when they affect either speech or writing, yield what would otherwise be
beyond reach: information on the human information machine. Where­
upon its replacement by mechanics can begin. Knie, Beach, Thurber, MaI­
ling Hansen, Ravizza: they all constructed their early typewriters for the
blind and/or the deaf. The Frenchmen Foucauld and Pierre even con­
structed them for the blind as blind people themselves. 20 Interest in au­
thorship, or in the possibility of reading one's unconscious outpourings in
the mirror, disappeared completely.
What the typewriters for the blind in mid century were still missing
was speed. But ever since r 8 ro, the introduction of the rotary press and
continuous form into the printing trade made typesetting machines desir­
able in which ( " as with a piano " ) "the various types fall, through a touch
of the keys, into place almost as quickly as one speaks. "21 And when
Samuel Morse patented his electric cable telegraph in r 840, he introduced
a communications technology whose speed of light far outpaced all forms
of manual communication. "The average speed, which can be sustained
for hours by hand, is about 20-25 words per minute. " 22 Consequently,
not long thereafter "a whole generation of telegraph operators had ap­
peared who could understand code much faster than they could write it
down. Stenographers found themselves in a similar fix. They could take
their notations as quickly as a man could speak, and yet they couldn't
transcribe faster than at a snail's pace."23
What therefore became part of the wish list were writing instruments
that could coincide with the operating speed of nervous pathways. Since
aphasia researchers had figured out the number of milliseconds it takes
for a letter to travel from the eye to the hand muscles via the brain's read-190

ing and writing centers, the equation of cerebral circuits with telegraphic
dispatches had become a physiological standard.24 When "the average la­
tency, that is, the time between the stimulus and the pushing of the button
takes about 250 milliseconds, " and when, furthermore, "the typing of a
given output resembles a flying projectile" because "it only needs a start­
ing signal" and "then goes all by itself"25-then, the typewriter as a
mass-produced article was bound to roll automatically off the production
lines of a gun manufacturer.
Unconfirmed rumors have suggested that Sholes sold the Remington
company a patent that he had stolen from the poor Tyrolean Peter Mit­
terhofer during his studies at the Royal and Imperial Poly technical Insti­
tute in Vienna.26 But plagiarism, or, in modern terms, the transfer of tech­
nology, is of little importance in the face of circumstances. Rumor has it
that, in reference to Mitterhofer's request for money, Emperor Franz
Joseph allegedly remarked to his cabinet that the invention of superior
war strategies would be more appropriate than that of useless typewrit­
ers. Remington & Son were above such pseudo-alternatives: they trans­
ferred "the standardization of the component parts of weapons, which
had been widely practiced since the Napoleonic Wars, " to those of civil
writing instruments.27 (Weapons manufacturers such as Mauser, Manu­
facture d' Armes de Paris, and the German Weapons and Ammunitions
Factory [DWF] were to follow suit.)
The technologies of typewriting and sound recording are by-products
of the American Civil War. Edison, who was a young telegrapher during
the war, developed his phonograph in an attempt to improve the process­
ing speed of the Morse telegraph beyond human limitations. RemingtonTypewriter

began the serial production o f Sholes's typewriter models in September
I 8 74 simply because "after the Civil War boom things had been on the
slow side," and they had "more capacity than they were using. "28
The typewriter became a discursive machine-gun. A technology whose
basic action not coincidentally consists of strikes and triggers proceeds in
automated and discrete steps, as does ammunitions transport in a revolver
and a machine-gun, or celluloid transport in a film projector. "The pen
was once mightier than the sword," Otto Burghagen, the first monogra­
pher of the typewriter, writes in I 898, " but where the typewriter rules,"
he continues, "Krupp's cannons must remain silent ! " 29 Burghagen is con­
tradicted, however, by his own deliberations on "the significant savings of
time, which endear the machine to the merchant. With its help one can
complete office work in a third of the time it would take with the pen, for
with each strike of a key the machine produces a complete letter, while
the pen has to undergo about five strokes in order to produce a letter . . . .
In the time it takes the pen to put a dot on the "i" or to make the "u"
sign, the machine produces two complete letters. The striking of the keys
follows in succession with great speed, especially when one writes with
all fingers; then, one can count five to ten keyboard hits per second! "30
This is the epic song of a firepower whose German record as of August
I98 5 stands at " 773 letters per minute for thirty minutes of high-speed
typing."31

late-nineteenth-century media-La voix humaine for the acoustics of the192

fects, and "for car radios, secret codes, and short-wave signals " 32_m lde
the typewriter into the titular hero of a play in 194 1 . The reason was
there in American idiom: for three acts, a detective chases an unknown
woman who has been tormenting her community with anonymous, type­
written letters, going by the title "the typewriter. "33 For three acts, he
"imagines the culprit at work at her typewriter, aiming and operating her
machine gun."34 Typewriters are simply "fast," not just "like Jazz" (as
Cendrars put it) but also like rapid-fire weapons. In her confession,
Cocteau's anonymous letter-writer puts it this way: "I wanted to attack
the whole city. All the hypocritical happiness, the hypocritical piety, the
hypocritical luxury, the whole lying, egotistical, avaricious, untouchable
bourgeoisie. I wanted to stir that muck, attack and reveal it. It was like a
hoax! Without accounting for myself, I chose the dirtiest and cheapest of
all weapons, the typewriter. " 35
About which the playwright, in his preface of 194 1 , only remarked
that he had "portrayed the terrible feudal province" of France "prior to
the debacle."36 As innocuous as they were, typewriters could still provide
cover for the work of Guderian's submachine guns and tank divisions.
And indeed: whereas the Army High Command supplied its war photog­
raphers with "Arriflex hand-held cameras, Askania Z-tripod cameras,
[and] special-assignment vehicles" and its recording specialists with " ar­
mored vehicles and tanks for radio broadcasts " and with magnetophones,
"war reporters were equipped solely with typewriters, and specifically,
most often with commercially available traveling typewriters. "37 Modesty
of literature under conditions of high technology.
That is precisely how Remington began production. The Model I
hardly sold, even though or precisely because one no less than Mark
Twain purchased a Remington in 1 8 74. He sent his novel Tom Sawyer,
the first typescript in literary history, to his publisher, and sent a para­
doxical letter of support to the typewriter manufacturer:

The Model II of 1 87 8 , which allowed the switch from lower to upper
case for a price of $ 1 25 , initially did not fare much better. But after a
slow start of 1 4 6 sales per year there came a rise that approximated a
global snowball effect.39 For in 1 8 8 1, the marketing strategists of Wyck­
off, Seamans, and Benedict made a discovery: they recognized the fasci­
nation their unmarketable machine held for the battalions of unemployed
women. When Lillian Sholes, as "presumably" the "first type-writer" in
history,40 sat and posed in front of her father's prototype in 1 872, female
typists came into existence for purposes of demonstration, but as a pro­
fession and career, the stenotypist had yet to come. That was changed by
the central branch of the Young Women's Christian Association in New
York City, which trained eight young women in 1 8 8 I to become typists
and immediately received hundreds of inquiries (at $ ro a week) from the
corporate world.41 A feedback loop was created connecting recruitment,
training, supply, demand, new recruitment, and so on-first in the United
States, and shortly thereafter through Christian women's associations in
Europe.42
Thus evolved the exponential function of female secretaries and the
bell curve of male secretaries. Ironically enough, the clerks, office helpers,
and poet-apprentices of the nineteenth century, who were exclusively
male, had invested so much pride in their laboriously trained handwrit­
ing as to overlook Remington's innovation for seven years. The continu­
ous and coherent flow of ink, that material substrate of all middle-class
in-dividuals and indivisibilities, made them blind to a historical chance.
Writing as keystrokes, spacing, and the automatics of discrete block let­
ters bypassed a whole system of education. Hence sexual innovation fol­
lowed technological innovation almost immediately. Without resistance
men cleared the field "where competition is as fierce as nowhere else. "43
Women reversed the handicap of their education, turning it into a "so­
called emancipation"44 that, all proletarian fascination notwithstanding,
wears the white collar of the employee of discourse.
In 1 8 5 3 , Hessian school regulations described knowledge of writing
and arithmetic as useful for girls but not indispensable.45 And women
"without any talent for arithmetic, with terrible handwriting, with aI94

highly deficient knowledge of orthography and mathematics" promptly
started "in droves " to "work on the typewriter"-so says a woman who
in I902 described the job of a female clerk "as building a church tower
in the air because one had forgotten the foundations. "46
But in the age of information, foundations no longer count. The fact
that "the female clerk could all-too-easily degrade into a mere type­
writer"47 made her an asset. From the working class, the middle class,
and the bourgeoisie, out of ambition, economic hardship, or the pure de­
sire for emancipation48 emerged millions of secretaries. It was precisely
their marginal position in the power system of script that forced women
to develop their manual dexterity, which surpassed the prideful hand­
writing aesthetics of male secretaries in the media system. Two German
economists noted it in I 895 :
Today, the typist has evolved into a kind of type: she is generally very high in de­
mand and is the ruling queen in this domain not only in America but in Germany
as well. It may come as a surprise to find a practical use for what has become a
veritable plague across the country, namely, piano lessons for young girls: the re-Typewriter
195
sultant dexterity is very useful for the operation of the typewriter. Rapid typing
on it can be achieved only through the dexterous use of all fingers. If this profes­
sion is not yet as lucrative in Germany as it is in America, it is due to the infiltra­
tion of elements who perform the job of typist mechanically, without any addi­
tional skills.49
Edison's mechanical storage of sound made obsolete the piano key­
board as the central storage device for music's scriptive logic; women
were no longer asked to endow lyrical letters with a singable, ersatz sen­
suality; the national plague of their dexterity could finally find a practical
use on typewriter keyboards (derived from the piano). And since power
after the print monopoly's collapse was diverted to cable and radio, to
the recording of traces and electrical engineering, outdated security pro­
tocols were dropped as well: women were allowed to reign over text pro­
cessing all by themselves. Since then, "discourse has been secondary" and
desexualized. 50
A certain Spinner, treasurer of the United States and a friend of Philo
Remington, gave an example of this change. The attrition of males dur­
ing the Civil War forced him to hire 300 women and to make the state­
ment, "that I authorized the hiring of women for positions in government
satisfies me more than all the other achievements in my life."51
One country after another opened the mail and wireless services as
well as the railroad to typists. Technological media needed technological
(or hysterical) media. In the German Reich, this was initially understood
only by Undersecretary of the Interior and Maj or General von Budde,
chief of the railroad division within the Great General Staff, who dictated
flawless orders to his secretaries every day and who committed subordi­
nate agencies to " an increased appropriation of typewriters."52 But the
German dream of men as civil servants and women as mothers weighed
heavily: what had to be created for girls involved in typing, telegraphing,
and telephoning was a special, temporary, civil-servant status that was
immediately revoked upon marriage. 53 Understood that way, communi­
cations technology amounted to "the disintegration of the old family
structure"54 and "denied" its female machine operators "a return to any
role in the family. "55
Global forms of disintegration put an end to the German dream. In
19 1 7, when the Army High Command built up its arsenal to prepare for
the Ludendorff offensive and screened the civil-service corps for battle
readiness, in a letter Hindenburg established the "principle" that, regard­
less of sex, "whosoever does not work, shall not eat." One year later, the

ported full compliance. "The offices of all manufacturers central to the
war effort have been occupied with female workers; they have conquered
even the orderly rooms of the army administration; shift work was al­
ways understaffed, and there was a constant demand for them. They were
absorbed in large quantities by the occupied territories; domestic admin­
istrative agencies of all kinds hired them in large numbers, let alone com-Olivetti M 2 0 . Poster by Piramo, Italy,

Heidegger observed in I93 5 . But only in order to doubt whether this " be­

the words of ministers and state secretaries. "57
Only his winter semester in Stalingrad revealed to the thinker-much
to the surprise of his listeners-the relationship among Being, Man, and
typewriter.
MARTIN H E I DEGGER O N THE HAND AND THE
TYPEWRITER ( I 9 4 2-4 3 )
Man himself acts [handelt] through the hand [Hand] ; for the hand is, to­
gether with the word, the essential distinction of man. Only a being which,
like man, "has" the word (1-1'680<;", ",oY0';;) , can and must "have" "the hand."
Through the hand occur both prayer and murder, greeting and thanks, oath
and signal, and also the "work" of the hand, the "hand-work," and the
tool. The handshake seals the covenant. The hand brings about the "work"
of destruction. The hand exists as hand only where there is disclosure and
concealment. No animal has a hand, and a hand never originates from a
paw or a claw or talon. Even the hand of one in desperation (it least of all)
is never a talon, with which a person clutches wildly. The hand sprang forth
only out of the word and together with the word. Man does not "have"
hands, but the hand holds the essence of man, because the word as the es­
sential realm of the hand is the ground of the essence of man. The word as
what is inscribed and what appears to the regard is the written word, i.e.,
script. And the word as script is handwriting.
It is not accidental that modern man writes "with" the typewriter and
"dictates" [diktiert] (the same word as "poetize" [dichten]) "into" a ma­
chine. This "history" of the kinds of writing is one of the main reasons for
the increasing destruction of the word. The latter no longer comes and goes
by means of the writing hand, the properly acting hand, but by means of the
mechanical forces it releases. The typewriter tears writing from the essential
realm of the hand, i.e., the realm of the word. The word itself turns into
something "typed. " Where typewriting, on the contrary, is only a transcrip­
tion and serves to preserve the writing, or turns into print something al­
ready written, there it has a proper, though limited, significance. In the timeTypewriter
199
o f the first dominance of the typewriter, a letter written o n this machine still
stood for a breach of good manners. Today, a handwritten letter is an anti­
quated and undesired thing; it disturbs speed reading. Mechanical writing
deprives the hand of its rank in the realm of the written word and degrades
the word to a means of communication. In addition, mechanical writing
provides this "advantage," that it conceals the handwriting and thereby the
character. The typewriter makes everyone look the same . . . .
Therefore, when writing was withdrawn from the origin of its essence,
i.e., from the hand, and was transferred to the machine, a transformation
occurred in the relation of Being to man. It is of little importance for this
transformation how many people actually use the typewriter and whether
there are some who shun it. It is no accident that the invention of the print­
ing press coincides with the inception of the modern period. The word-signs
become type, and the writing stroke disappears. The type is " set," the set
becomes "pressed. " This mechanism of setting and pressing and "printing"
is the preliminary form of the typewriter. In the typewriter we find the ir­
ruption of the mechanism in the realm of the word. The typewriter leads
again to the typesetting machine. The press becomes the rotary press. In ro­
tation, the triumph of the machine comes to the fore. Indeed, at first, book
printing and then machine type offer advantages and conveniences, and
these then unwittingly steer preferences and needs to this kind of written
communication. The typewriter veils the essence of writing and of the
script. It withdraws from man the essential rank of the hand, without man's
experiencing this withdrawal appropriately and recognizing that it has
transformed the relation of Being to his essence.
The typewriter is a signless cloud, i.e., a withdrawing concealment in
the midst of its very obtrusiveness, and through it the relation of Being to
man is transformed. It is in fact signless, not showing itself as to its essence;
perhaps that is why most of you, as is proven to me by your reaction,
though well intended, have not grasped what I have been trying to say.
I have not been presenting a disquisition on the typewriter itself, re­
garding which it could j ustifiably be asked what in the world that has to do
with Parmenides. My theme was the modern relation ( transformed by the
typewriter) of the hand to writing, i.e., to the word, i.e., to the unconcealed­
ness of Being.
A meditation on unconcealedness and on Being does not
merely have something to do with the didactic poem of Parmenides, it has
everything to do with it. In the typewriter the machine appears, i.e., tech­
nology appears, in an almost quotidian and hence unnoticed and hence sign­
less relation to writing, i.e., to the word, i.e., to the distinguishing essence of
man.
A more penetrating consideration would have to recognize here that200
Typewriter
the typewriter is not really a machine in the strict sense of machine technol­
ogy, but is an "intermediate" thing, between a tool and a machine, a mecha­
nism. Its production, however, is conditioned by machine technology.
This "machine," operated in the closest vicinity to the word, is in use; it
imposes its own use. Even if we do not actually operate this machine, it de­
mands that we regard it if only to renounce and avoid it. This situation is
constantly repeated everywhere, in all relations of modern man to technol­
ogy. Technology is entrenched in our history.58
" Our writing tools are also working on our thoughts, " Nietzsche wrote.59
"Technology is entrenched in our history, " Heidegger said. But the one
wrote the sentence about the typewriter on a typewriter, the other de­
scribed (in a magnificent old German hand) typewriters per se. That is
why it was Nietzsche who initiated the transvaluation of all values with
his philosophically scandalous sentence about media technology. In r 8 8 2,
human beings, their thoughts, and their authorship respectively were re­
placed by two sexes, the text, and blind writing equipment. As the first
mechanized philosopher, Nietzsche was also the last. Typescript, accord­
ing to Klapheck's painting, was called The Will to Power.
Nietzsche suffered from extreme myopia, anisocoria, and migraines
(to say nothing of his rumored progressive paralysis) . An eye doctor in
Frankfurt attested that Nietzsche's "right eye could only perceive mis­
shapen and distorted images" as well as "letters that were virtually be­
yond recognition, " whereas the left, "despite its myopia," was in r 877
still capable of "registering normal images." Nietzsche's headaches there­
fore appeared to be " a secondary symptom, " 60 and his attempts to phi­
losophize with a hammer the natural consequence of " an increased stim­
ulation of the site in the prefrontal wall of the third ventricle responsible
for aggression. " 61 Thinkers of the founding age of media naturally did
not only turn from philosophy to physiology in theory; their central ner­
vous system always preceded them.
Nietzsche himself successively described his condition as quarter
blindness, half-blindness, three-quarter blindness (it was for others to
suggest mental derangement, the next step in this mathematical se­
quence) . 62 Reading letters (or musical notes) distorted beyond recognition
became painful after twenty minutes, as did writing. Otherwise, Nietz­
sche would not have attributed his "telegram style,"63 which he developedTypewriter
20 r
Konrad Klapheck, The Will to Power, 19 5 9 . (Reproduced courtesy of the artist)
while writing the suggestively titled The Wanderer and His Shadow, to
his eye pain. To direct the blindness of this shadow, he had been planning
to purchase a typewriter as early as r 8 79, the so-called "year of blind­
ness. " 64 It happened in r 8 8 1 . Nietzsche got "in touch with its inventor, a
Dane from Copenhagen. " 65 "My dear Sister, I know Hansen's machine
quite well, Mr. Hansen has written to me twice and sent me samples,
drawings, and assessments of professors from Copenhagen about it. This
is the one I want (not the American one, which is too heavy). "66
Since our writing tools also work on our thoughts, Nietzsche's choice
followed strict, technical data. En route between Engadine and the Riv­
iera, he decided first for a traveling typewriter and second as the cripple
that he was. At a time when "only very few owned a typewriter, when202
Typewriter
there were no sales representatives [in Germany] and machines were
available only under the table,"67 a single man demonstrated a knowledge
of engineering. (With the result that American historians of the typewriter
elide Nietzsche and Hansen. )68
Hans Rasmus Johann Malling Hansen ( r 83 5-90), pastor and head of
the royal D¢vstummeinstitut in Copenhagen,69 developed his skrivekugle /
writing ball / sphere ecrivante out of the observation that his deaf-mute
patients' sign language was faster than handwriting. The machine "did
not take into account the needs of business "7o but rather was meant to
compensate for physiological deficiencies and to increase writing speed
(which prompted the Nordic Telegraphy Co. to use "a number of writing
balls for the transfer of incoming telegrams " ) . 71 Fifty-four concentrically
arranged key rods (no levers as yet) imprinted capital letters, numbers,
and signs with a color ribbon onto a relatively small sheet of paper that
was fastened cylindrically. According to Burghagen, this semispheric
arrangement of the keys had the advantage of allowing "the blind, for
whom this writing ball was primarily designed, to learn writing on it in a
surprisingly short time. On the surface of a sphere each position is com­
pletely identifiable by its relative location . . . . It is therefore possible to be
guided solely by one's sense of touch, which would be much more diffi­
cult in the case of flat keyboards. " 72 That is precisely how it could have
been stated in the assessments of professors from Copenhagen for a half­
blind ex-professor.
In r 8 6 5 Malling Hansen received his patent, in r 8 67 he started serial
production of his typewriter, in r 8 7 2 the Germans (and Nietzsche ? )
learned o f it from the Leipziger Illustrirte Zeitung.73 Finally, i n r 8 8 2 the
Copenhagen printing company of C. Ferslew combined typing balls and
women-as a medium to offset the nuisance that "their female typeset­
ters were significantly more preoccupied with the decoding of handwrit­
ten texts than with the actual setting of text. " 74 McLuhan's law that the ·
typewriter causes " an entirely new attitude to the written and printed
word" because it "fuses composition and publication" 75 was realized for
the first time. (Today, when handwritten publisher's manuscripts are rar­
ities, "the entire printing industry, via the Linotype, depend[s] upon the
typewriter. " ) 76
In the same year and for the same reasons, Nietzsche decided to buy.
For 375 Reichsmarks ( shipping not included)77 even a half-blind writer
chased by publishers was able to produce "documents as beautiful and
standardized as print. " 78 "After a week" of typewriting practice, Nietz­
sche wrote, "the eyes no longer have to do their work " :79 ecriture au-Typewriter
203
tomatique had been invented, the shadow of the wanderer incarnated. In
March r 8 8 2, the Berliner Tageblatt reported:
The well-known philosopher and writer [sic] Friedrich Nietzsche, whose failing
eyesight made it necessary for him to renounce his professorship in Basel three
years ago, currently lives in Genoa and-excepting the progression of his afflic­
tion to the point of complete blindness-feels better than ever. With the help of a
typewriter he has resumed his writing activities, and we can hence expect a book
along the lines of his last ones. It is widely known that his new work stands in
marked contrast to his first, significant writings. 80
Indeed: Nietzsche, as proud of the publication of his mechanization
as any philosopher,81 changed from arguments to aphorisms, from
thoughts to puns, from rhetoric to telegram style. That is precisely what
is meant by the sentence that our writing tools are also working on our
thoughts. Malling Hansen's writing ball, with its operating difficulties,
made Nietzsche into a laconic. "The well-known philosopher and writer"
shed his first attribute in order to merge with his second. If scholarship
and thinking, especially toward the end of the nineteenth century, were
allowed or made possible only after extensive reading, then it was blind­
ness and blindness alone that "delivered" them from "the book. " 82
Good news from Nietzsche that coincided with all the early type­
writer models. None of the models prior to Underwood's great innovation
of r 89 7 allowed immediate visual control over the output. In order to
read the typed text, one had to lift shutters on the Remington model,
whereas with Malling Hansen's-notwithstanding other claims 83-the
semicircular arrangement of the keys itself prevented a view of the paper.
But even Underwood's innovation did not change the fact that typewrit­
ing can and must remain a blind activity. In the precise engineering lingo
of Angelo Beyerlen, the royal stenographer of Wiirttemberg and the first
typewriter dealer of the Reich: "In writing by hand, the eye must con­
stantly watch the written line and only that. It must attend to the creation
of each sign, must measure, direct, and, in short, guide the hand through
each movement. " A media-technological basis of classical authorship that
typewriting simply liquidates: "By contrast, after one briefly presses down
on a key, the typewriter creates in the proper position on the paper a com­
plete letter, which is not only untouched by the writer's hand but also lo­
cated in a place entirely apart from where the hands work." With Under­
wood's models, too, "the spot where the next sign to be written occurs" is
"precisely what . . cannot be seen. " 84 After a fraction of a second, the
act of writing stops being an act of reading that is produced by the grace

of a human subject. With the help of blind machines, people, whether
blind or not, acquire a historically new proficiency: ecriture automatique.
Loosely translating BeyerJen's dictum that "for writing, visibility is as
unnecessary today as it has always been," 85 an American experimental
psychologist (who in I904 measured the "Acquisition of Skill in Type­
Writing" and who obliged his subjects to keep typed test diaries) recorded
documentary sentences like those of Andre Breton:Typewriter

"A Funny Story About the Blind, etc . " (Beyerlen's essay title) was
also the story of the mechanized philosopher. Nietzsche's reasons for pur­
chasing a typewriter were very different from those of his few colleagues

Hart, Nansen, and so onY They all counted on increased speed and tex-206

tual mass production; the half-blind, by contrast, turned from philosophy
to literature, from rereading to a pure, blind, and intransitive act of writ­
ing. That is why his Malling Hansen typed the motto of all modern, high­
brow literature: "Finally, when my eyes prevent me from learning any­
thing-and I have almost reached that point! I will still be able to craft
verse. " 88
1 8 89 is generally considered the year zero of typewriter literature,
that barely researched mass of documents, the year in which Conan
Doyle first published A Case of Identity. Back then, Sherlock Holmes
managed to prove his claim that the typed love letters ( including the sig­
nature) received by one of London's first and ostensibly myopic typists
were the work of her criminal stepfather engaging in marriage fraud. A
machine-produced trick of anonymization that prompted Holmes, seven­
teen years prior to the professionals in the police, to write a monograph
entitled On the Typewriter and Its Relation to Crime. 89
Our esteem for Doyle notwithstanding, it is nonetheless an optical­
philological pleasure to show that typewriting literature began in 1 8 82-
with a poem by Friedrich Nietzsche that could well be titled On the Type­
writer and Its Relation to Writing.
In these typed, that is, literally forged or crafted, verses, three mo­
ments of writing coincide: the equipment, the thing, and the agent. An
author, however, does not appear because he remains on the fringes of the
verse: as the addressed reader, who would "utilize" the "delicate " 90 writ­
ing ball known as Nietzsche in all its ambiguity. Our writing tool not only
works on our thoughts, it "is a thing like me. " Mechanized and automatic
writing refutes the phallocentrism of classical pens. The fate of the
philosopher utilized by his fine fingers was not authorship but feminiza­
tion. Thus Nietzsche took his place next to the young Christian women
of Remington and the typesetters of Malling Hansen in Copenhagen.
But that happiness was not to last long. The human writing ball spent
two winter months in Genoa to test and repair its new and easily mal­
functioning favorite toy, to utilize and compose upon it. Then the spring
on the Riviera, with its downpours, put an end to it. "The damned writ­
ing," Nietzsche wrote, self-referentially as always, "the typewriter has
been unusable since my last card; for the weather is dreary and cloudy,
that is, humid: then each time the ribbon is also wet and sticky, so that
every key gets stuck, and the writing cannot be seen at all. If you think
about it! ! "91A facsimile of Nietzsche's Mailing Hansen poem, February-March 1 8 8 2 . The
text reads, " THE WRITING BALL IS A THING LIKE ME: MADE OF / IRON / YET EASILY
TWISTED ON JOURNEYS. / PATIENCE AND TACT ARE REQUIRED IN ABUNDANCE, / AS
WELL AS FINE FINGERS, TO USE US. " (Reproduced courtesy of the Stiftung
Weimarer Klassik, Goethe-Schiller-Archiv)208
Typewriter
And so it was a rain in Genoa that started and stopped modern writing­
a writing that is solely the materiality of its medium. "A letter, a litter, " a
piece of writing, a piece of dirt, Joyce mocked. Nietzsche's typewriter, or
the dream of fusing literary production with literary reproduction, instead
fused again with blindness, invisibility, and random noise, the irreducible
background of technological media. Finally, letters on the page looked
like the ones on the right retina.
But Nietzsche did not surrender. In one of his last typewritten letters
he addressed media-technological complements and/or human substitu­
tion: the phonograph and the secretary. "This machine," he observed in
another equation of writing equipment with writer, " is as delicate as a lit­
tle dog and causes a lot of trouble -and provides some entertainment.
Now all my friends have to do is to invent a reading machine: otherwise
I will fall behind myself and won't be able to supply myself with sufficient
intellectual nourishment. Or, rather: I need a young person who is intelli­
gent and knowledgeable enough to work with me. I would even consider
a two-year-long marriage for that purpose. " 92
With the collapse of his machine, Nietzsche became a man again. But
only to undermine the classical notion of love. As with men since time im­
memorial and women only recently, " a young person" and a "two-year­
long marriage" are equally suitable to continue the failed love affair with
a typewriter.
And so it happened. Nietzsche's friend Paul Ree, who had already
transported the Malling Hansen to Genoa, was also searching for its hu­
man replacement: somebody who could " aid" Nietzsche " in his philo­
sophical studies with all kinds of writing, copying, and excerpting. "93 But
instead of presenting an intelligent young man, he presented a rather no­
torious young lady who, "on her path of scholarly production," required
a "teacher" :94 Lou von Salome.
And so a defunct typewriter was replaced by the most famous me�
nage a trois of literary history. The question of whether, when, and in
what grouping Professor Nietzsche, Dr. Ree, and Ms. von Salome went to
bed with one another may be amusing to psychologists. But the question
as to why young women of the Nietzsche era could replace his writing
ball and even his proverbially rare students is of priority to us. The locally
known sister of the globally known brother (as Pschorr put it) gave an an­
swer to that question. In her monograph, Friedrich Nietzsche and the
Women of His Time, Elisabeth Forster described how professors at the
University of Zurich "very much appreciated having emancipated women
of the time at universities and libraries as secretaries and assistants "95 (es-Typewriter
209
pecially once emancipation had "gradually taken on more temperate
forms" and was no longer synonymous with gender war). With the logi­
cal consequence that young women from Russia or Prussia (where the
management of discourse and higher education was to remain a male mo­
nopoly until 190 8 ) had every reason to enroll, as did Lou von Salome, at
the philosophical faculty of Zurich. With the further logical consequence
that former professors of the University of Basel had every reason to wel­
come them as secretaries and assistants. At any rate, the die had long been
cast before an impassioned philosopher and his Russian love climbed
Monte Sacro . . .
Nietzsche's philosophy simply implemented the desexualization of
writing and the university. Since no colleague and hardly a student in
Basel could be enthused about Nietzsche's most deeply felt wish, namely,
to establish a Zarathustra chair, Nietzsche dismantled the elementary bar­
rier of philosophical discourses. He recruited his students from the
women who had just recently been admitted to the universities. Lou von
Salome was only one of many students of philosophy in Zurich who con­
tacted him: aside from her, there were the forgotten names Resa von
Schirnhofer, Meta von Salis, and especially Helene Druskowitz, who suc­
ceeded (and competed with) Nietzsche all the way to her death in an in­
sane asylum. Curiously enough, what Nietzsche called The Future of Our
Institutions of Higher Education began, of all places, in the quiet and re­
moved Engadine. Beginning in 1 8 8 5, emancipated women students trav­
eled to Sils Maria " only to get to know better Prof. Nietzsche, who ap­
peared to them as the most dangerous enemy of women."96
But that's how it goes. Just as the hundred-year-Iong exclusion of
women from universities and philosophy led to the idealization of grand
Dame Nature, so their renewed inclusion altered philosophy as such.
What Hegel in his youth called Love (and a Love that was one with the
Idea), Nietzsche in Ecce Homo notoriously transvalued into the definition
that "Love in its means, [is] war; at bottom, the deadly hatred of the
sexes. " 97 And if the new philosopher, following such insights, fought
against emancipation as a form of conscientious obj ection and even de­
fined Woman as both truth and untruth, only female philosophers had an
answer. The hatred for males of Helene Druskowitz, Nietzsche's former
student, even outdid his hatred for women. The escalation of positions in
the work of two writers, a man and a woman, gave proof of Nietzsche's
media-specific notion of heterosexuality.
Nietzsche and Lou von Salome's honeymoon would have been nice
and forgotten. Their ceaselessly escalating gender war is what started210
Typewriter
Nietzsche's fame. Women (and Jews) brought an almost completely si­
lenced ex-professor back into the public. Whether out of hatred, as with
Druskowitz, or love, Nietzsche's private students became writers, and
their careers in turn afforded them the opportunity to write books on
Nietzsche. " With all kinds of writing, copying, and excerpting, " as de­
sired, women did their secretarial work.
That is j ust how precisely Nietzsche registered discursive changes.
Even if the system of higher education had attuned him, as it did all oth­
ers, to handwriting and academic homosexuality, he himself started some­
thing new. The two relayed innovations of his time, writing machines and
writing women, recorded his speech.
" Our writing tools are also working on our thoughts. " Hence Nietz­
sche's next thought-four years after the malfunctioning of his type­
writer-was to philosophize on the typewriter itself. Instead of testing
Remington's competing model, he elevated MaIling Hansen's invention to
the status of a philosophy. And this philosophy, instead of deriving the
evolution of the human being from Hegel's spirit (in between the lines of
books) or Marx's labor (in between the differential potential of muscular
energy), began with an information machine.
In the second essay of On the Genealogy of Morals, knowledge,
speech, and virtuous action are no longer inborn attributes of Man. Like
the animal that will soon go by a different name, Man derived from for­
getfulness and random noise, the background of all media. Which sug­
gests that in 1 8 8 6, during the founding age of mechanized storage tech­
nologies, human evolution, too, aims toward the creation of a machine
memory. Guyau's argument presupposes the phonograph, Nietzsche's, the
typewriter. To make forgetful animals into human beings, a blind force
strikes that dismembers and inscribes their bodies in the real, until pain
itself brings forth a memory. People keep promises and execute orders
only after torture.
Writing in Nietzsche is no longer a natural extension of humans who
bring forth their voice, soul, individuality through their handwriting. On
the contrary: just as in the stanza on the delicate MaIling Hansen, humans
change their position-they turn from the agency of writing to become an
inscription surface. Conversely, all the agency of writing passes on in its
violence to an inhuman media engineer who will soon be called up by
Stoker's Dracula. A type of writing that blindly dismembers body parts
and perforates human skin necessarily stems from typewriters built before
1 897, when Underwood finally introduced visibility. Peter Mitterhofer's
Model 2, the wooden typewriter prototype of 1 8 66, unlike the MaIlingTypewriter
2I I
Hansen did not even have types and a ribbon. Instead, the writing paper
was perforated by needle pins-inscribing, for example, in a rather
Nietzschean manner, the proper name of the inventor.
Such is the solidarity among engineers, philosophers, and writers of
the founding age of media. Beyerlen's technical observation that in typ­
ing, everything is visible except the actual inscription of the sign, also de­
scribes On the Genealogy of Morals. Neither in Nietzsche nor in Stoker
can the victims see and hence read what the "most dreadful sacrifices and
pledges," "the most repulsive mutilations," and "the cruelest rites"98 do
to their body parts. The only possible, that is unconscious, kind of read­
ing is the slavish obedience called morals. Nietzsche's notion of inscrip­
tion, which has degenerated into a poststructuralist catch-all metaphor,
has validity only within the framework of the history of the typewriter. It
designates the turning point at which communications technologies can
no longer be related back to humans. Instead, the former have formed the
latter.
Under conditions of media the genealogy of morals coincides with the
genealogy of gods. Following Beyerlen's law-namely, the invisibility of the
act of inscription-we can deduce the necessary existence of beings that
could be either observers or, as with Dracula, masters of inhuman commu­
nications technologies. "So as to abolish hidden, undetected, unwitnessed
suffering from the world and to deny it, one was in the past virtually com­
pelled to invent gods and genii of all the heights and depths; in short some­
thing that even roams in secret, hidden places, sees even in the dark, and
will not easily let an interesting painful spectacle pass unnoticed."99
It is Nietzsche's most daring experimental setup to occupy the place
of such a god. If God is dead, nothing is there to prevent the invention of
gods . "The poor man," as he was described by an emancipated woman,
"is a true saint and ceaselessly working, even though he is almost blind
and can neither read nor write (except with a machine) " l OO-this poor
man identifies with Dionysus, the master of media. Once again, philoso­
phizing or studying are followed by the crafting of verse. On the Geneal­
ogy of Morals deploys itself in rhythms and unfolds an interesting and
painful spectacle: Nietzsche's dithyrambs of Dionysus entitled Ariadne's
Complaint. Composing and dictating into a machine are, following Hei­
degger's recollection, in word and deed one and the same thing.212
Typewriter
Ariadne's composed lament arises out of complete darkness or blind­
ness. She speaks about and to a "veiled" god that tortures her body, fol­
lowing all the rules of mnemotechnology or memory inscription de­
scribed in Genealogy. Dionysus has neither word nor style nor stylus­
except for torture itself. His female victims are faced with the painful
attempt to decode from their bodily pain the trace of a desire, which is
truly the desire of the other. And only after 1 50 lines or laments can Ari­
adne read that she herself desires the desire of the god:
Come back!
With all your torments!
All the streams of my tears
run their course to you!
and the last flame of my heart
it burns up to you.
Oh come back,
my unknown god! my pain!
my last happiness pOI
This last cry is not a fiction. It is a quotation-from one of the new
women writers. One of Lou von Salome's poems, accompanied by Nietz­
sche's music, contained the following lines: "Have you no more happiness
to share with me, so be it! as yet you have your torment. " The poet of
dithyrambs is once again only a secretary who puts the words of one
woman, von Salome, into the mouth of another woman, Ariadne. And as
the Genealogy predicted, the god of inscription can and must come forth
from inscribed pain itself. After Ariadne's or Salome's last cry, the long­
concealed Dionysus himself becomes "visible" in blinding and "emerald
beauty. " The dithyrambs come to a necessary close because their answer
transmits plain text: the whole scene of writing has been a scene of torture:
Be wise Ariadne! . . .
You have little ears, you have ears like mine:
let some wisdom into them!-
Must we not first hate ourself if we are to love ourself? . . .
I am thy labyrinth . . . 102
A Dionysus that occupies the ear of his victims and inserts smart
words turns into a poet (Dichter) or dictator in all senses of the word. He
dictates to his slave or secretary to take down his dictation. The new no­
tions of love and heterosexuality become reality when one sex inserts
painful words into the ear of the other. University-based, that is, male,
discourses on and about an alma mater are replaced by the discourse ofTypewriter
2 I 3
two sexes about their impossible relationship: Lacan's rapport sexuel.
That is why Nietzsche describes Dionysus's existence as an "innovation"
once he has invented him as a "philosopher. " Unlike Socrates with his
Greek noblemen, and unlike Hegel with his German civil-servant appren­
tices, Dionysus dictates to a woman. According to Nietzsche, Ariadne's
Complaint is j ust one of the many "celebrated dialogues" between Ari­
adne and her "philosophical lover" on Naxos.1 03
The Naxos alluded to here was not a fiction either, but the future of
Germany's institutions of higher education. The widow of Max Weber
has described how new female students, "from unheard-of intellectual
points of contact with young men, " were afforded "unlimited opportuni­
ties for innovative human relationships " : "camaraderie, friendship,
love." 104 (To say nothing of the innovative human relationships that, as in
the case of Lou Andreas-Salome, grew out of the opportunities between
male and female psychoanalysts.) Following the double loss of his MaIling
Hansen and his Salome, Nietzsche at any rate was on the lookout for sec­
retaries into whose ears he could insert Dionysian words. For Zarathustra
and his whip he "needed . . . just somebody to whom he could dictate the
text"-and "Fraulein Horner fell from the sky," it seems, precisely "for
that purpose. " 105 Then, for Beyond Good and Evil, that Foreplay to Phi­
losophy of the Future, a certain Mrs. Roder-Wiederhold set foot on the is­
land of Naxos.
"I am your labyrinth, " Dionysus said to the tortured Ariadne, who in
turn had herself been the mistress of the labyrinth during the Cretan rit­
ual dance. And Zarathustra added that poet-dictators who write in blood
and aphorisms want not to be read but to be learned by heart.106 That is
precisely why Mrs. Roder-Wiederhold caused some problems. Unfortu­
nately, certain gods, demons, intermediate beings of Europe had already
inserted the morality of Christendom and of democracy into her ears.
That made the scene of dictation in Engadine into a scene of torture. Her
own hand had to write down what was beyond good and evil, beyond
Christendom and morality. Ariadne's complaint turned into an empirical
event. Every history of writing technologies has to account for the fact
that Beyond Good and Evil was not easily written. Nietzsche knew and
wrote it. "In the meantime I have the admirable Mrs. Roder-Wiederhold
in the house; she suffers and tolerates 'angelically' my disgusting 'anti-de­
mocratism'-as I dictate to her, for a couple of hours every day, my
thoughts on Europeans of today and-Tomorrow; in the end, I fear, she
may still 'fly off the handle' and run away from Sils-Maria, baptized as
she is with the blood of r 84 8 . " 107214
Typewriter
Against human and/or technological typewriters such as Nietzsche
and the MaIling Hansen, substitute secretaries could not compete. Nietz­
sche stuck to his love affair with the writing ball from January through
March 1 8 82: "Between the two of us," the media master wrote about his
"admirable woman " : "I can't work with her, I don't want to see a repeat
( Wiederholung). Everything I dictated to her is without value; as well, she
cries more often than I can handle. " lo 8
A complaint of Ariadne that her dictator might have been able to
foretell: "Must we not first hate ourself if we are to love ourself? . . . "
Nietzsche and his secretaries, no matter how ephemeral and forgot­
ten, have introduced a prototype into the world. Word processing these
days is the business of couples who write, instead of sleep, with one an­
other. And if on occasion they do both, they certainly don't experience ro­
mantic love. Only as long as women remained excluded from discursive
technologies could they exist as the other of words and printed matter.
Typists such as Minnie Tipp, by contrast, laugh at any romanticism. That
is why the world of dictated, typed literature-that is, modern litera­
ture-harbors either Nietzsche's notion of love or none at all. There are
desk couples, two-year-long marriages of convenience, there are even
women writers such as Edith Wharton who dictate to men sitting at the
typewriter. Only that typed love letters-as Sherlock Holmes proved once
and for all in A Case of Identity-aren't love letters.
The unwritten literary sociology of this century. All possible types of
industrialization to which writers respond have been thoroughly re­
searched-ranging from the steam engine and the loom to the assembly
line and urbanization. Only the typewriter, a precondition of production
that contributes to our thinking prior to any conscious reaction, remains
a critical lacuna. A friend writes or dictates a biography of Gottfried
Benn. Upon rereading the 200 typed pages, he begins to realize that he is
writing about himself: the biographer and the writer have the same ini­
tials. After 200 additional pages, his secretary asks him whether he has
noticed that secretaries and writers (Schriftsteller) have the same ini­
tials . . . . Lacan's three registers cannot possibly be demonstrated more ef­
fectively: the real of the writer, the imaginary of his doppelganger, and, fi­
nally, as elementary as forgotten, the symbolic of machine writing.
Under such conditions, what remains to be done is to start a register of
the literary desk couples of the century (Bermann's film was never realized).
Case I. When, beginning in 1 8 83 , Wyckoff, Seamans, & Benedict
developed a sales network and (following the example of Mark Twain)Typewriter
2 15
solicited writers to advertise typewriting, "the Petrograd salesman came
up with the most spectacular big name, Count Lyof Nikolayevitch Tol­
stoy, a man who loathed modern machinery in every form ( "The most
powerful weapon of ignorance -the diffusion of printed matter. "-War
and Peace, epilogue, part 2, chapter 8 ), and got a great photograph of the
author, looking quite miserable, dictating to his daughter, Alexandra
Lvovna, who sat poised over the Remington keyboard." 109
Case 2. When Christiane von Hofmannsthal finished the sixth grade
of secondary school, instead of continuing on she transferred to learn
Gabelsberg stenography and typewriting. In 19 19 her father and poet
wrote about how difficult it would be if he "had to do without the little
one as my typist, which she is. " 1 10
Case 3 . In 1 897, Hofmannsthal's Austria allowed female graduates
of secondary school to study philosophy, in 1900, medicine (including
state exams and the doctorate). Consequently, Sigmund Freud, university
professor of nerve pathology, began his Introductory Lectures on Psycho­
Analysis in Vienna during the winter semester of 19 I 5-16 with the revo­
lutionary address, "Ladies and Gentlemen! " Since "the ladies among you
have made it clear by their presence in this lecture-room that they wish to
be treated on an equality with men," Freud scorned "science . . . for
schoolgirls " l 11 and identified primary sexual markers by their names. He
told the women in the lecture hall that the secular distribution of gender
roles, including the symbols of pen and natural paper, was psychoanalyt­
ically obsolete: " Women possess as part of their genitals a small organ
similar to the male one."
Women, however, who have a "clitoris " 1 12 in the real, and who are
"wood, paper, . . . books" l13 in the symbolic of the dream, stood on both
sides of writing technologies' gender differences. Nothing and nobody
barred them anymore from professions involving case studies and hence
writing. Sabina Spielrein, Lou Andreas-Salome, Anna Freud, and so on,
up until today: female psychoanalysts became historically possible. An in­
stitution that banned phonographs from its examination rooms and ig­
nored the cinema altogether still adjusted its writing equipment. "In Feb­
ruary [of 19 1 3 J Freud took the novel step of buying a typewriter . . . . But
it was not for himself, for there was no question of his employing an
amanuensis and giving up his beloved pen. It was simply to help Rank to
cope with his increasing editorial duties. " Exceeding the mechanization
of psychoanalytical secretaries and film interpreters, the machine also al-216
Typewriter
tered their sex; for, curiously enough, the typewriter, according to the
same biographer, remained not with Rank but in the lifetime possession
of Anna Freud, the bridal daughter and psychoanalyst.1 14
"Typewriter," after all, signifies both: machine and woman. Two
years after the purchase of the machine, Freud wrote to Abraham from
Hofmannsthal's Vienna: "A quarter of an hour ago I concluded the work
on melancholy. I will have it typewritten so that I can send you a copy. " 11 5
Case 4. In 1907, Henry James, the writer and brother of Miinster­
berg's great sponsor, shifted his famous, circumlocutionary style of novel
writing toward " Remingtonese. " 11 6 He hired Theodora Bosanquet, a
philosopher's daughter who had worked for the offices of Whitehall on
the Report of the Royal Commission on Coast Erosion and who learned
to type for James's sake. After a job interview, during which James came
across as a "benevolent Napoleon, " l 1 7 novel production got under way.
The Remington, along with its operator, "moved into his bedroom,"
where dictation "pulled" texts from James "so much more effectively and
unceasingly" than did "writing." Soon a reflex loop was created: only the
clanking of the typewriter induced sentences in the writer. "During a fort­
night when the Remington was out of order he dictated to an Oliver type­
writer with evident discomfort, and he found it almost impossibly discon­
certing to speak to something that made no responsive sound at all. " 1 18
So it went for seven years, until a less benevolent Napoleon said
farewell. James had several strokes in 19 I 5 . His left leg became paralyzed,
and his sense of orientation in space and time was impaired; only the con­
ditioned reflex of pure, intransitive dictation remained intact. Writing in
the age of media has always been a short circuit between brain physiol­
ogy and communications technologies-bypassing humans or even love.
Hence, James ordered the Remington, along with Theodora Bosanquet
(not the other way around) , to his deathbed, in order to record the real
behind all fiction. Henry James had become emperor and dictated: a let­
ter to his brother Joseph, the king of Spain; a decree specifying new con­
struction at the Louvre and in the Tuileries; finally, some prose on the
death of the royal eagle and the cowardice of its common murderers.l l 9
That is how deliriously, how lucidly a paralyzed brain recorded itself, the
situation, and the system of media. From 1 8 00-1 8 1 5, Napoleon's noted
ability to dictate seven letters simultaneously produced the modern gen­
eral staff. His secretaries were generals and a marshal of France.J 20 From
1907-1 7, a typewriter and its female operator produced the modern
American novel. From that, imperial eagles died.Typewriter
2I7
Case 5 . Thomas Wolfe, who made a point o f selling his American
novels in a highly industrialized fashion, by word count ( 3 50,000 in the
case of Look Homeward, Angel), 121 was nevertheless
the most completely un-mechanical of men and never knew how to operate a
typewriter, although on at least two occasions he got machines and swore that he
would learn. He rented a Dictaphone in 193 6, in the hope that he could recite his
work into it and have it typed up later, but the only thing he ever actually dictated
was a few remarks on the ancestry and character of his most unfavorable critic,
Bernard De Voto. He would sometimes play this back and listen to it, grinning.
At any rate, because of his inability to type, he hired a stenographer for $25
a week, who came each day and transcribed his longhand as fast as he could get
it down on paper . . . . A typist had to have both practice and a vivid imagination
to read what he had written, and most of them worked for him for only a short
time. He was constantly distracted by this difficulty: "I can always find plenty of
women to sleep with," he once blurted out, " but the kind of woman that is really
hard for me to find is a typist who can read my writing. " 122
Case 6. In I93 5, Dr. Benn quit his medical practice to serve as chief
medical officer for the recruitment inspection offices in Hannover. Re­
maining in Berlin were two female friends whom Thomas Wolfe would
have had no trouble finding: the actresses Tilly Wedekind and Ellinor
Biiller-Klinkowstrom. But the military, Benn's aristocratic form of emi­
gration, had its everyday problems. After two "terribly lonesome and se­
cluded years, " he wrote to the second of the two women:
The sheets are torn, the bed isn't done from Saturday through Monday, I've got
to do the shopping myself, even getting the heating stove going, sometimes. I don't
respond to letters, since I've nobody to do the writing for me. I don't do any
work, since I neither have the time nor solace nor anybody to dictate to. At 3 :30
in the afternoon, I make some coffee, that is the one content of my life. At nine in
the evening I go to bed, that's the other. Like cattle. 12 3
On the Genealogy of Morals predicted it all: in the chaos without
recording technologies, literature basically had to take the shape de­
scribed by Benn's tripartite organization: First, a beer or wine pub, read­
ing, meditating, and radio listening, in order to bring highbrow poetry up
to par with the sound and standard of popular songs. Second, an " old
desk ( 7 3 cm x I 3 5 cm) " with unread "manuscripts, j ournals, books,
sample medication packages, an inkpad (for recipes), three pens, two ash­
trays, one phone, " in order to "scribble " the poem the next day in one of
those physician's scrawls that Benn "himself could not read." Finally, an­
other desk, "the decisive one," equipped with microscope and typewriter,2 I 8
Typewriter
to convert the "scribbles" into "typewritten materials," in order to make
the material " accessible to judgment" and prepare for "the feedback flow
from the inspired to the critical 1." 124 The whole process operated as a
perfect feedback loop, with the hitch that Benn "himself did not type
well." 125 With "nobody to dictate to," it was hardly possible to deal ade­
quately with the material on paper, and hence the media competition of
radio and cinema was overwhelming.
More fortunate than his colleagues Nietzsche and Wolfe, however, the
writer made a find in Hannover. Benn entered a "marriage of companion­
ship" 126 that was to come to an end only during the World War, when his
typewriting wife committed suicide. In Berlin two women friends received
their last handwritten letters; the fact that one of them answered with a
typewritten letter127 was no match for the technological competition.
I must make one more try to establish a serious human relationship and, with its
help, to escape from the morass of my life.
Morchen, you may know everything, but nobody else does. And when I now
describe to you what kind of a person she is, someone who will almost certainly
become unhappy, you will be surprised.
Much younger than myself, about 30. Not a bit pretty in the sense of Elida
and Elisabeth Arden. Very nice body, but negroid face. From a very well-respected
family. No money. Job similar to that of Helga, well paid, types about 200 sylla­
bles, a perfect typist. 128
Two hundred syllables per minute are pretty close to 773 keystrokes,
the German typing record of 198 5 . Modern literature could be produced
in the Wehrmacht and the Army High Command simply because the
daughter of an officer's widow, Herta von Wedemeyer-following the ex­
ample of the female protagonist of a 1 894 noveP29-worked as secretary.
Case 7. ( so as not to forget, amidst all those writers, "les Postes en
general," that is, general secretaries and general field marshals) .130 " By
virtue of a decree of the erstwhile Pruss ian Ministry of Commerce and
Trade of July 1 7, 1 897, typewritten documents were deem� d admissible
in dealings with the government. " l3l Official (or government) texts were
rendered anonymous and laid the groundwork for Herta von Wede­
meyer's profession. Which had consequences not only for chief medical
officers but also for their ultimate superior, the minister of war. Nine days
prior to Benn's second marriage and in the same city,
on January 1 2 [ I93 8 ] , General Field Marshal von Blomberg, who since I93 2 had
been widowed and had two sons and three daughters, married the former stenog-August Walla, typeface, 198 5 . (Reproduced courtesy of Dr. Johann Feilacher,

rapher Erna Gruhn, a secretary of the Imperial Egg Center (Reichseierzentrale),
in the presence of a small circle of friends. Witnesses: Adolf Hitler and Hermann
Goring. The couple went on their honeymoon immediately. Shortly thereafter,
senior investigator Curt Hellmuth Miiller, chief of the Center for Personnel Iden­
tification in the Central Office of Criminal Justice, received a load of indecent
photographs.
"Mrs. General Field Marshal, " more faithful to Bertillon than Minnie
Tipp, was "registered" with the authorities.132 Hitler could take over chief
command of the army himself.
Case 8. Once, shortly before the onset of war, fear of cancer drove
Hitler to "the extraordinary effort" of "writing down his will by hand."
Other than that, like most people in command, Hitler "had for years been
used to dictating his thoughts into the typewriter or the shorthand re­
port." 133 A specially constructed typewriter with larger type was at his
disposal. This typewriter, however, did not solve all the problems involved
in coordinating a world war from the Fuhrer's headquarters, Wolfs­
schanze. The official historian of the Army High Command saw reason to
record a rather inofficious version of the end of the war. It was widely
known that great situation conferences would take place around 1 300
hours. Hitler, by contrast, had set up "his daily routine " so that
Jodi could present to him at around II and, surrounded by a small circle, the mes­
sages and the maps of engagements be compiled overnight. Sometimes it got later,
since Hitler was fond of drinking tea with his close advisers after a day's work Of,
as happened regularly, of staying with his stenographers until about 4 A.M. Mili­
tarily speaking, it was highly inconvenient that he then slept well into the day and
was not to be disturbed.1 34
But even Fuhrer-typewriters and secretaries, which Hitler preferred
over his joint General Staff at the Wolfsschanze, could not decide wars. In
order to do that, the Second World War had to produce somewhat more
complicated typewriters that did away with literature altogether . . . .
First, we need to conclude that fictive cases 9 (Mina Harker + Dr. Seward
in Stoker), 10 (Minnie Tipp + poets in Bermann), I I (Mademoiselle Lust
+ Faust in Valery), and their numerous successors (Breidenbach, Bronnen,
Gaupp, Heilbut, Kafka, Keun) are anything but fictive. Desk couples have
replaced literary love pairs. Only in film scripts or romances do both co­
incide in a happy end. After Mina Harker for half the novel has collected,
recorded, typed, and carbon-copied all discourses on Dracula until the
latter has been done away with, she still ends up being a mother. After herTypewriter
22I
German namesake has made a poet successful and sterile, "they type"
(paraphrasing Dante) " no more on that day. " According to a beautiful
tautology, sexes relayed through media will reunite through media as well.
Heilbut's Friihling in Berlin ( Spring in Berlin) , Gaupp's Nacht von heute
auf morgen ( Sudden night) are novels about typewriter romances. And the
30 film renditions of Stoker do not even show phonography and type­
writing, so that true love comes to triumph over Dracula. The good for­
tune of media is the negation of their hardware.
Empirically speaking, women employed in processing discourses are
likely to have a successful career. Word processing, somewhere amidst the
relays of technological communications networks, breaks up couples and
families. Precisely at that gap evolves a new job: the woman author. Ri­
carda Huch became one (in I9 IO) after studying in Zurich ( I 8 8 8-9 I ) and
working as a secretary in the university's main library ( I 89 I-97). Ger­
trude Stein became one after working in the office of and conducting ex­
periments at the Harvard psychological laboratory headed by her patron,
Munsterberg. Theodora Bosanquet became one after working for eight
years in the delirious general staff. Tatj ana Tolstoy, inspired by her sister's
Remington, wrote her first article on a typewriter and mailed it anony­
mously to her father, who would not have been " impartial" otherwise.
Tolstoy was instantly enthused. 1 35
Anonymity and pseudonymity (as formerly with the female poets
who wrote in the shadow of the Ur-author, Goethe) are hardly necessary
these days. Whether typewriting authors are called Lindau, Cendrars,
Eliot, or Keun, Schlier, or Bruck does not count for much in relation to
the mass media. A desexualized writing profession, distant from any au­
thorship, only empowers the domain of text processing. That is why so
many novels written by recent women writers are endless feedback loops
making secretaries into writers. Sitting in front of autobiographical type­
writers, Irmgard Keun's heroines simply repeat the factual career of their
author. Paula Schlier's Konzept einer Jugend unter dem Diktat der Zeit
(Concept of a youth under the dictates of time) , that extraordinarily pre­
cise subtitle for a secretary, hears in "the regular clanging of letters . . .
the melody accompanying all the madness of the world: " 1 36 from world­
war field hospitals and lectures in Munich to the editorial office of the
Volkische Beobachter and the Beer Hall Putsch. Christa Anita Bruck's
Schicksale hinter Schreibmaschinen (Destinies behind typewriters) is an
autobiography without mention of love, only the desire to help those222
Typewriter
"women who are not interested in motherhood" to have a breakthrough
as women writers.137 And since, during office dictation, " a self-regulating
machine somewhere in the head chops up the meaning of what the hand,
antenna-like, receives," 138 ecriture automatique is no longer difficult:
Tempo, Tempo, faster, faster.
Man funnels his energy into the machine. The machine, which is he himself,
his foremost abilities, his foremost concentration and final exertion. And he him­
self is machine, is lever, is key, is type and moving carriage.
Not to think, not to reflect, on, on, fast, fast, tipp, tip, tipptipptipptipptipp­
tipp . . . 139
At its high point, typewriter literature means repeating ad infinitum
Minnie Tipp's proper name or the advertising slogan on her office door.
(Up until Helene Cixous, women will write that only writing makes
women into women.) The relay unit of human and machine exercises a
pull that can even replace love. First with female typists, then with their
male counterparts. That Kafka's love was a media network is confirmed
at the height of German literary history by Case 1 2 .
Felice Bauer ( 1 8 8 7-1960), who was employed after graduation in
1908 as a stenographer for the Odeon record company, switched in 1909
to Carl Lindstrom A.-G., the largest German manufacturer of dicta­
phones and gramophones (with a daily output of 1 , 5 00 units). 14o Within
three years there, beginning as a simple typist, she made a business career
highly unusual for women: with her power of attorney she was entitled
to sign " Carl Lindstrom A.-G. " At exactly that time, during a trip to Bu­
dapest in the summer of 19 1 2, Ms. Bauer visited the family of Max Brod,
the head of personnel for the Prague postal service.14 1
Present on this occasion was a young and little-published writer who
was just putting together his first book for Rowohlt and who, at first, saw
in the traveling woman nothing but a " bony, empty face" that "wore its
emptiness openly. " 142 Until the potential inscription surface dropped a
sentence that "so amazed" Dr. Kafka "that I banged on the table " :
You actually said you enjoyed copying manuscripts, that you had also been copy­
ing manuscripts in Berlin for some gentleman (curse the sound of that word when
unaccompanied by name and explanation! ) . And you asked Max to send you
some manuscripts.143
That is how quickly a typist's lust taught a (hand)writer a love that,
even in the shape of jealousy, wasn't one. Since only professors in Berlin
and friends involved in information technology were privileged to haveTypewriter
223
their manuscripts typed and readied for publication, Kafka had no choice
but-in an unusual step for him-to go to work on the typewriter him­
self. Whereas the "main" and "happy" part of Kafka's work consisted in
"dictating to a living being" in the office,144 the endless stream of love let­
ters to Felice Bauer started, as if negating love itself, with a typescript.
"But dearest Felice ! " Kafka wrote a year later, "Don't we write about
writing, the way others talk about money? " 145 Indeed: from the first letter
to the last, their impossible relationship was a feedback loop of text pro­
cessing. Time and again, Kafka avoided traveling to Berlin with his hand,
the hand that once held Felice Bauer's. Instead of the absent body there
arrived a whole postal system of letters, registered letters, postcards, and
telegrams in order to describe that "hand" with "the hand now striking
the keys . " What remained of "personal typing idiosyncrasies" was only
what was simultaneously of interest to The Criminological Uses of Type­
writing, namely, the "types of mistake correction" : first, with skilled typ­
ists; second, with unskilled typists; and third, with "skilled typists on an
unaccustomed system. " 146 Kafka counted himself among the third group,
and of the twelve typos in his first letter, four, that is, a highly significant
33 percent, involved the pronouns "ich" (I) and "Sie " (you). As if the typ­
ing hand could inscribe everything except the two bodies on either end of
the postal channel. As if the "fingertips " themselves had taken the place
of his insufficient "mood" by the name of Ego. And as if the self-critical
"mistake, " which Kafka "realized" in self-critical amplification while
"inserting a new sheet of paper, " coincided with nervous typos.
Kafka's call For the Establishment and Support of a Military and
Civilian Hospital for the Treatment of Nervous Diseases in German Bo­
hemia stated:
This great war which encompasses the sum total of human misery is also a war
on the nervous system, more a war on the nervous system than any previous war.
All too many people succumb to this war of nerves. Just as the intense industrial­
ization of the past decades of peace had attacked, affected, and caused disorders
of the nervous system of those engaged in industry more than ever before, so the
enormously increased mechanization of present-day warfare presents the gravest
dangers and disorders to the nervous system of fighting men.147
Under its initial conditions of a "war of nerves" between literature
and Carl Lindstrom A.-G., the exchange of love letters was doomed to
fail, even though it later switched to handwriting and returned to "in­
creased mechanization " only in 19 16, when typed postcards were the
fastest way of passing through the war censorship between Prague andA r b e i t e r- U n fa l l - V e r s i c h e r u n g s - A n s t a l t

Franz Kafka's first letter to Felice Bauer.
Berlin, Austria and Prussia. 148 In 19 I 7, while Lindstrom's acoustical me­
dia network, with its financial leverage, helped the Army High Command
establish the film corporation UFA,149 Kafka terminated his engagement
to Felice Bauer. Shortly thereafter, the woman, freed from the bombard­
ment of letters, married an affluent Berlin businessman.
In one of his last letters to his last female pen pal, however, Kafka
took stock: of misused love letters and communications vampires, of re­
duced physical labor and information machines.
How on earth did anyone get the idea that people can communicate with one an­
other by letter! Of a distant person one can think, and of a person who is near one
can catch hold-all else goes beyond human strength. Writing letters, however,
means to denude oneself before the ghosts, something for which they greedily
wait. Written kisses don't reach their destination, rather they are drunk on the
way by the ghosts. It is on this ample nourishment that they multiply so enor­
mously. Humanity senses this and fights against it and in order to eliminate as far

tion, the peace of souls, it has invented the railway, the motorcar, the aeroplane.
But it's no longer any good, these are evidently inventions made at the moment of
crashing. The opposing side is so much calmer and stronger; after the postal ser­
vice it has invented the telegraph, the telephone, the radiograph. The ghosts won't
starve, but we will perish. ISO
Hence only ghosts survive the Kafka-Bauer case: media-technological
projects and texts reflecting the material limitations of the written word.
Even though, or because, Kafka considered the "very existence " of
gramophones "a threat, " 151 he submitted to his employee of a phono­
graph manufacturer a series of media links that were supposed to be able
to compete with Lindstrom's empire. Aside from a direct link involving a
parlograph, which "goes to the telephone in Berlin" and conducts "a lit­
tle conversation" with a "gramophone in Prague, " Kafka envisions a
"typing bureau where everything dictated into Lindstrom's Parlographs is
transcribed on a typewriter, at cost price, or at first perhaps a bit below
cost price." 152 That was not, of course, the most up-to-date proposition
(thanks to Dr. Seward and Mina Harker), but one with a future. In Bron­
nen's monodrama Ostpolzug of I926, " an electrically hooked-up dicta­
phone dictates into an equally electric typewriter. " 153 And since "the ma­
chine makes further inroads " into "the function of brains " themselves,
instead of merely "replacing the physical labor of man, . . . a typewriter
is announced [in I9 25] that will make the typist superfluous and will
translate the sound of words directly into typed script. " 154
Kafka, however, for whom Ms. Bauer did not type a single manu­
script, let alone construct media networks, stuck to old-fashioned litera­
ture. From the typewriter he only learned to dodge the phantasm of au­
thorship. As with his first love letter, the "I," "the nothingness that I
am, " 155 disappeared under deletions or abbreviations until all that re­
mained was a Joseph K. in The Trial and a K. by itself in The Castle. The
office machines of his days also freed the Kafka of his literary nights from
the power of attorney, that is, the authority to sign documents:
I could never work as independently as you seem to; I slither out of responsibility
like a snake; I have to sign many things, but every evaded signature seems like a
gain; I also sign everything (though I really shouldn't) with FK only, as though
that could exonerate me; for this reason I also feel drawn to the typewriter in any­
thing concerning the office, because its work, especially when executed at the
hands of the typist, is so impersonal.l56

phasize. The " disparition elocutoire du poete " 157 urged by Mallarme be­
comes reality. Voice and handwriting treacherously could fall subject to
criminal detection; hence every trace of them disappears from literature.
As Jacques Derrida, or "J.D.," observes in a May 1979 love letter whose
address must also be without (a) proper name(s):
What cannot b e said above all must not be silenced, b u t written. Myself, r a m a
man of speech, r have never had anything to write. When r have something to say
r say it or say it to myself, basta. You are the only one to understand why it really
was necessary that r write exactly the opposite, as concerns axiomatics, of what r
desire, what r know my desire to be, in other words you: living speech, presence
itself, proximity, the proper, the guard, etc. r have necessarily written upside
down-and in order to surrender to Necessity.
and "fort" de toi.
r must write you this (and at the typewriter, since that's where r am,
sorry: . . ) .158
.
Hence Derrida's Postcard consists of one continuous stream of typed
letters punctuated by phone calls that are frequently mentioned but never
recorded. Voice remains the other of typescripts.
"I, personally, " Benn says about Problems of Poetry (Probleme der
Lyrik), "do not consider the modern poem suitable for public reading,
neither in the interest of the poem nor in the interest of the listener. The
poem impresses itself better when read . . . . In my judgment, its visual ap­
pearance reinforces its reception. A modern poem demands to be printed
on paper and demands to be read, demands the black letter; it becomes
more plastic by viewing its external structure. " 159 Hence a Pallas named
Herta von Wedemeyer solves all problems of poetry because she trans­
forms Benn's scribbled ideas-"a lifeless something, vague worlds, stuff
thrown together with pain and effort, stuff brought together, materials
that have been grouped, improved upon and left undeveloped, loose,
untested, and weak" 16°-via transcription into art. Under the conditions
of high technology, Pallas, the goddess of art, is a secretary.
"Fundamentally, the typewriter is nothing but a miniature printing
press." 161 As a doubled spatialization of writing-first on the keyboard,
then on the white paper-it imparts to texts an optimal optical appear­
ance. And, following Benjamin's forecast, as soon as "systems with more
variable typefaces" (such as rotating head typewriters or thermal print­
ers) become available, "the precision of typographic forms" can directly
enter "the conception of . . . books . " " Writing [is] advancing ever more
deeply into the graphic regions of its new eccentric figurativeness" : 162Typewriter

typographic poems that attempt to bring writers on par with film and
phonography,163 to poesie concrete, that form of pure typewriter poetry.
T. S. Eliot, who will be " composing" The Waste Land "on the type­
writer, " "finds" (no different from Nietzsche) "that I am sloughing off all
my long sentences which I used to dote upon. Short, staccato, like modern
French prose. " Instead of " subtlety, " "the typewriter makes for lucid­
ity, " 164 which is, however, nothing but the effect of its technology on
style. A spatialized, numbered, and (since the r 8 8 8 typewriters' congress
in Toronto) also standardized supply of signs on a keyboard makes pos­
sible what and only what QWERTY prescribes.
Foucault's methodical explanation, the last and irreducible elements
of which are at the center of his discourse analysis, can easily eliminate
the sentences of linguistics, the speech acts of communications theory, the
statements of logic. Only to be confronted by two factual conditions that
seem to fulfill all the criteria for an elementary "statement" of discourse
analysis: "The pile of printer's character which I can hold in my hand, or
the letters marked on the keyboard of a typewriter. " 165 Singular and spa­
tialized, material and standardized, stockpiles of signs indeed undermine
so-called Man with his intentions and the so-called world with its mean­
ing. Only that discourse analysis ignores the fact that the factual condi­
tion is no simple methodical example but is in each case a techno-histor­
ical event. Foucault omits the elementary datum (in Latin, the casting of
dice or coup de des) of each contemporary theoretical practice and begins
discourse analysis only with its applications or configurations: "the key­
board of a typewriter is not a statement; but the same series of letters, A,
Z, E, R, T, listed in a typewriting manual, is the statement of the alpha­
betical order adopted by French typewriters." 166
Foucault, the student of Heidegger, writes that "there are signs, and230

that is enough for there to be signs for there to be statements,"167 only to
point for once to the typewriter keyboard as the precondition for all pre­
conditions. Where thinking must stop, blueprints, schematics, and indus­

tionship of Being to Man, who has no choice but to become the site of
their eternal recurrence. A, Z, E, R, T . . .

Remington's and Underwood's invention ushered in a poetics that
William Blake or John Donne with their limits/ears could not hear, for it
transcends mystical tigers in the silence of the night, or a metaphysical
erotics between heaven and confessional. Only the excessive media link
of optics and acoustics, spellings and acronyms, between the letters, num­
bers, and symbols of a standardized keyboard makes humans (and
women) as equal as equal signs. Blake's " tiger, tiger, burning bright," is
succeeded by the stenographer, that burning poet's bride. The history of

Toward the end of the First World War, a young and ironic Carl
Schmitt conceived the world history of inscription. To rewrite it here in its
entirety is impossible, simply because res gestae and res narratae coincide.
It is enough that the diary-typing machines called Buribunks, as well as
the "twenty divisions " of buribunkological dissertations, 1 69 have evolved
from humble beginnings into a modern loop of endless replication.

Today, because we have been granted the privilege of enj oying the glorious
notion of the diary at its zenith, we tend to overlook what a majestic deed
man performed when-perhaps as the unknowing instrument of the world
spirit-he planted with the first innocuous note the first seed, which now
overshadows the earth as a gigantic tree. A certain, I would say, moral feel­
ing of obligation urges us to question what historical personage embodies
the precursor to this wonderful epoch, the messenger pigeon that the world
spirit has sent in advance of its last and most highly refined period. We are
obliged to put this question at the center of our principal investigation.23 2

It would be a mighty triumph for Buribunkology if it could identify a
hero such as Don Juan as its ancestor and-in opposition to the charge of
scholarly absentmindedness-take pride in its paradoxical descent from
this virile and decidedly unscholarly cavalier. Indeed, Don Juan's conquests
have been registered, but the crucial point is to whom the intellectual prop­
erty of this idea can be attributed. In his champagne aria, Don Juan himself
smgs-
Ah, la mia lista doman mattina
d'una decina devi aumentar
-a feeling of which the true Buribunkologist is frequently possessed when
he ponders the daily increasing scope or the daily rising number of his pub­
lications. He may very well be tempted to compare his sense of achievement
with the plucky self-confidence of the frivolous conqueror of women. Still,
this seductive parallel should not distract us from the profound seriousness
of our endeavor or lead us to lose the distance from our possible founding
father, which sober objectivity and detached science dictate to us. Did Don
Juan really have the specifically buribunkological attitude that urged him to
keep a diary, not for the sake of recording, superficially, his manly con­
quests, but-if I may say so-out of a sense of sheer obligation and debt
vis-a-vis history? We cannot believe so. Don Juan had no interest in the
past, just as he fundamentally had no interest in the future, which for him
did not go beyond the next conquest; he lived in the immediate present, and
his interest in the individual erotic adventure does not point to any signs of
a beginning self-historicization. We cannot detect any signs of the attitude
characterizing the Buribunk, which originates from the desire to record
every second of one's existence for history, to immortalize oneself. Like the
Buribunk keeping a diary, Don Juan relishes each individual second, and in
that there is certainly a similarity of psychological gesture. Instead of conse­
crating his exploits on the altar of history in the illuminated temple, how­
ever, he drags them into the misty cave of brutal sensuality, devouring them
animal-like to satiate his base instincts. ". Not for a single moment does he
have what I would like to call the cinematic attitude of the Buribunk-he
". Hence, one could say that Don Juan is not one who ruminates upon lived
experience, if one were to charge the buribunkological keeping of a diary with
being a kind of intellectual rumination. That such a claim is untenable is easy to
prove, for the diary-keeping Buribunk does not experience anything prior to his
entries; rather, the experience consists precisely in the making of an entry and
its subsequent publication. To speak of rumination is thus simply nonsense,
because there is no initial act of chewing and swallowing.Typewriter
233
never apprehends himself a s the subject-object o f history-in which the
world soul, writing itself, has become realized. And the register that Lep­
orello keeps for him he takes along only as an afterthought, as a delectable
flavoring for his horizontal delights. Hence, we have legitimate doubt
whether, for example, from the
1,003
Spanish representatives, more than
three owe their entry into the register to the very existence of the register it­
self. Put differently, we wonder whether Don Juan has been prompted into
action by his inner need to start and keep a register, if only in those three
cases, the way numerous major achievements in the arts, in science, in
everyday life have been produced solely with the idea of their recorded exis­
tence in a diary or newspaper-the diary of the masses-in mind. The reg­
ister was never the final cause; in implementing the acts of innervation at is­
sue, it was-in the rectangle of psychological forces-relegated to the role
of an accidental, of an accompanying positive motor. Thus, for us Don Juan
is finished.
All the more interesting is the behavior of Leporello. He relishes the
sensuous leftovers of his master, a couple of girls, a couple of choice
morsels; for the most part, he accompanies his master. A Buribunk does not
do that, for a Buribunk is unconditionally and absolutely his own master, he
is himself. Gradually, however, what awakens in Leporello is the desire to
partake in the escapades of his master by writing them down, by taking
note of them, and it is at this moment that we see the dawn of Buribunk­
dom. With the aid of a commendable trick he surpasses his master, and if he
does not become Don Juan himself, he becomes more than that; he changes
from Don Juan's wretched underling into his biographer. He becomes a his­
torian, drags Don Juan to the bar of world history, that is, world court, in
order to appear as an advocate or prosecutor, depending on the result of his
observations and interpretations.
Was Leporello, however, cognizant of the implications of starting his
register as the first step in a gigantic development? Certainly not. We do not
want to dismiss the mighty effort behind the small register of the poor
buffo, but we cannot under any circumstances recognize him as a conscious
Buribunk-how should he have done it, anyway, the poor son of a beautiful
but culturally retrograde country in which the terror of papal inquisition
has crushed and smashed all remaining signs of intelligence? He was not
meant to see his nonetheless significant intellectual work come to fruition;
he holds the treasure-laden shrine, but he does not hold the key to it. He has
not understood the essential and has not said the magic words that open the
way to Aladdin's cave. He was lacking the consciousness of the writing sub­
ject, the consciousness that he had become the author of a piece of world234
Typewriter
history and hence a juror on the world court-indeed, to exercise control
over the verdict of the world court, because his written documents were
proof more valid than a hundred testimonies to the contrary. Had Leporello
had the strong will to this kind of power, had he ventured the magnificent
leap to become an independent writing personality, he would first have writ­
ten his own autobiography; he would have made a hero of himself, and in­
stead of the frivolous cavalier who fascinates people with his shallow dispo­
sition, we would quite probably have gotten the impressive picture of a su­
perior manager who, with his superior business skills and intelligence, pulls
the strings of the colorful marionette, Don Juan. But instead of taking pen
into fist, the poor devil clenches his fist in his pocket.
Upon close scrutiny, the utter inadequacy of Leporello's registration
method appears in numerous defects. He puts photographs in sequence
without ever making an attempt to shape the heterogeneous discontinuity of
successive seductions into a homogeneous continuity; what is missing is the
mental thread, the presentation of development. We don't get any sense of
demonstrated causal connections, of the mental, climatic, economic, and so­
ciological conditions of individual actions, nothing relating to an aesthetic
observation about the ascending or descending bell curve of Don Juan's
evolving taste. Similarly, the register has nothing to say about the specific
historical interest in the uniqueness of each individual procedure or in each
individual personality. Leporello's disinterest is utterly incomprehensible; he
does not even communicate any dismay when he is daily witness to his mas­
ter's ingenious sexuality-how it is aimlessly scattered to the winds instead
of being rationally disseminated into purposive population growth. Still
less evident is his willingness to provide reliable research data on details:
nowhere does Leporello inquire into the deeper motivations of individual
seductions, nowhere do we find sociologically useful data on the standing,
origin, age, and so on of Don Juan's victims, as well as their pre-seduction
lives-at most, we are left with the summary conclusion (which is probably
not sufficient for a more serious scientific investigation) that they came from
" every station, every form, and every age . " We also don't hear anything
about whether the victims later organized themselves into a larger, commu­
nal mass initiative and provided mutual economic support-which no doubt
would have been the only right thing to do, given their numbers. Naturally,
what is also missing is any statistical breakdown within the respective cate­
gories, which would have recommended itself in light of the high number of
1,003 ; even more,
what is missing is any indication as to how the dumped
girls had been taken care of by the welfare system, which in many cases had
become necessary. Naturally as well, there is no inkling that, in light of theTypewriter
23 5
brutal exploitation of male social superiority in relation to defenseless
women, the introduction of female suffrage is a most urgent and legitimate
demand. It would be in vain to ask for the larger precepts that underlie the
development of the collective soul, the subjectivism of the time, the degree
of its excitation. In a word, inadequacy here is turned into reality. Leporello
is oblivious to the welter of the most urgent scientific questions-much to
his own disadvantage, because he has to submit his obliviousness to the
judgement of history. Oblivious to pressing questions, he did not engage in
as much as one investigation that the most immature student of the humani­
ties today would have pounced upon, and hence missed the opportunity of
evolving the consciousness necessary to recognize the significance of his own
identity. The dead matter has not been conquered by the intellectual labor
of its workman, and the flyers on the advertisement pillars continue to an­
nounce: Don Juan, the chastised debauchee, and not: Leporello's tales . . . .
Not until Ferker did the diary become an ethical-historical possibility;
the primogeniture in the realm of Buribunkdom is his. Be your own history!
Live, so that each second of your life can be entered into your diary and be
accessible to your biographer! Coming out of Ferker's mouth, these were big
and strong words that humanity had not yet heard. They owe their distribu­
tion into the nooks and crannies of even the most remote villages to a
worldwide organization aimed at disseminating his ideas, an organization
well managed and having the support of an intelligent press. No village is so
small that it is without a blacksmith, as the old song went; today, we can
say with not a little pride that no village is so small that it is not imbued
with at least a touch of Buribunkic spirit. The great man, '" who presided
like the chief of a general staff over his thousands of underlings, who guided
his enormous business with a sure hand, who channeled the attention of the
troops of researchers to hot spots, and who with unheard-of strategic skill
focused attention on difficult research problems by directing pioneering dis-
.' On this issue, all relevant documents show a rare unanimity. In his diary,
Maximilian Sperling calls him "a smart fellow" (Sperling's Diaries, vol. 1 2, ed.
Alexander Bumkotzki [Breslau, 1909], p. 8 16). Theo Timm, in a letter of August
21 to Kurt Stange, describes him as "a fabulous guy" ( Timm's Letters, vol. 2 1 ,
ed. Erich Veit [ Leipzig, 19 19] , p. 498 ) . In her diary, Mariechen Schmirrwitz says,
"I find him splendid" (vol. 4, ed. Wolfgang Huebner [Weimar, 1920], p. 4 3 5 ).
Following his first meeting with the man himself, Oskar Limburger exclaims,
"He is enormous, watch out for him" (Memories of my Life, ed. Katharina
Siebenhaar [Stuttgart, 1903], p. 87). Prosper Loeb describes him as of a "de­
monic nature" (Konigsberg, 1 899, p. 108 ) . He is a "heck of a guy, " says Knut
vom Heu in his letters to his bride (edited by their son Flip; Frankfurt a.M.,
19 1 8, p. 7 1 ) , and so on.23 6

sertations-this impressive personality experienced a truly sensational rise.
Born of humble origins and educated without Latin in the middle school of
his small town, he successively became a dentist, a bookmaker, an editor,
the owner of a construction company in Tiflis, the secretary of the head­
quarters of the international association to boost tourism on the Adriatic
coast, the owner of a movie theater in Berlin, a marketing director in San
Francisco, and, eventually, Professor of Marketing and Upward Mobility at
the Institute of Commerce in Alexandria. This is also where he was cre­
mated and, in the most grandiose style, his ashes processed into printer's
ink, as he had specified in detail in his will and which was sent in small por­
tions to printing presses all over the world. Then, with the aid of flyers and
billboards, the whole civilized world was informed of this procedure and
was furthermore admonished to keep in mind that each of the billions of
letters hitting the eye over the years would contain a fragment of the im­
mortal man's ashes. For eons, the memorial of his earthly days will never
disappear; the man-who even in death is a genius of factuality-through
an ingenious, I would say antimetaphysical-positivist gesture, secured him­
self a continued existence in the memory of humanity, a memory, moreover,
that is even more safely guaranteed through the library of diaries that he re­
leased in part during his lifetime, in part after his death. For at each mo­
ment of his momentous life he is one with historiography and the press; in
the midst of agitating events he coolly shoots film images into his diary in
order to incorporate them into history. Thanks to this foresight, and thanks
as well to his concomitant selfless research, we are informed about almost
every second of the hero's life . . . .
Now we are finally in a position to define historically the crucial contri­
bution of this ingenious man: not only has he made the radically transfor­
mative idea of the modern corporation feasible for human ingenuity with­
out leaving the ground of the ethical ideal; not only has he demonstrated
through his life that one can build a career of purposive ambition and still
be an ethically complete being, bound under the sublation of the irreconcil­
able duality of matter and mind in a way that invalidates the constructions
of theologizing metaphysics, which were inimical to the intellectual climate
of the twentieth century, through a victorious new idealism; he has, and this
is the crux, found a new, contemporary form of religion by strictly adhering
to an exclusionary positivism and an unshakable belief in nothing-but-mat­
ter-of-factness. And the mental region in which these numerous and contra­
dictory elements, this bundle of negated negations, are synthesized-the un­
explainable, absolute, essential that is part of every religion-that is nothing
but the Buribunkological.Typewriter
237
N o Buribunkologist who i s also a genuine Buribunk will utter the name
of this man without the utmost reverence. That we must emphasize u p
front. F o r when we disagree with the critical appraisal of o u r hero by noted
Ferker scholars in the following discussion, we do so not without emphatic
protest against the misunderstanding that we fail to recognize Ferker's
tremendous impulses and the full stature of the man. Nobody can be more
informed by and imbued with his work than we are. Nevertheless, he is not
the hero of Buribunkdom but only its Moses, who was permitted to see the
promised land b ut never to set foot on it. Ferker's truly noble blood is still
tinged with too many unassimilated, alien elements; atavistic reminiscences
still cast their shadow over long periods of his life and dim the pure image
of self-sufficient, blue-blooded Buribunkdom. Otherwise, it would be inex­
plicable that the noble man, doubting his inner sense of self, shortly before
his death was willing not only to enter into a bourgeois-religious marriage
but also to marry his own housekeeper-a woman who we know was com­
pletely uneducated, downright illiterate, and who eventually (aside from in­
hibiting the free exfoliation of his personality) sought to prevent, for rea­
sons of devout bigotry, his cremation . . . . To have surpassed these inconsis­
tencies and to have made Buribunkdom, in its crystal-clear purity, into a
historical fact is the work of Schnekke.
As a fully matured fruit of the most noble Buribunkdom, this genius fell
from the tree of his own personality. In Schnekke we find not the least visi­
ble trace of hesitation, not the slightest deviation from the distinguished line
of the Ur-buribunkological. He is nothing more than a diary keeper, he lives
for his diary, he lives in and through his diary, even when he enters into his
diary that he no longer knows what to write in his diary. On a level where
the I, which has been projecting itself into a reified, you-world constellation,
flows with forceful rhythm back into a world-I constellation, the absolute
sacrifice of all energies for the benefit of the inner self and its identity has
achieved the fullest harmony. Because ideal and reality have here been fused
in unsurpassable perfection; what is missing is any particular singularity,
which shaped Ferker's life in such a sensational way but which, for any dis­
cussion focusing on the essential, must be understood as a compliment
rather than a critique. Schnekke is, in a much more refined sense than Fer­
ker, a personality, and precisely because of that has he disappeared behind
the most inconspicuous sociability. His distinct idiosyncrasy, an I deter­
mined solely by the most extreme rules of its own, is located within a spec­
trum of indiscriminate generality, in a steady colorlessness that is the result
of the most sacrificial will to power. Here we have reached the absolute
zenith of Buribunkdom; we need not be afraid of any relapse, as with23 8
Typewriter
Ferker. 'f The empire of Buribunkdom has been founded. For in the midst
of his continuous diaries, Schnekke (with his strong sense of generality and
his universal instinct) saw the opportunity to detach the diary from its re­
strictive bond with the individual and to convert it into a collective organ­
ism. The generous organization of the obligatory collective diary is his
achievement. Through that, he defined and secured the framing conditions
of a buribunkological interiority; he elevated the chaotic white noise of dis­
connected and single Buribunkdom into the perfect orchestration of a Buri­
bunkie cosmos. Let us retrace the broad lines of development of this socio­
logical architecture.
Every Buribunk, regardless of sex, is obligated to keep a diary on every
second of his or her life. These diaries are handed over on a daily basis and
collated by district. A screening is done according to both a subject and a
personal index. Then, while rigidly enforcing copyright for each individual
entry, all entries of an erotic, demonic, satiric, political, and so on nature are
subsumed accordingly, and writers are catalogued by district. Thanks to a
precise system, the organization of these entries in a card catalogue allows
for immediate identification of relevant persons and their circumstances. If,
for example, a psychopathologist were to be interested in the pubescent
dreams of a certain social class of Buribunks, the material relevant for this
research could easily be assimilated from the card catalogues. In turn, the
work of the psychopathologist would b e registered immediately, s o that, say,
a historian of psychopathology could within a matter of hours obtain reli­
able information as to the type of psychopathological research conducted so
far; simultaneously-and this is the most significant advantage of this dou­
ble registration-he could also find information about the psychopathologi­
cal motivations that underlie these psychopathological studies. Thus
" What a difference there is between Ferker's and Schnekke's attitudes
toward women! Never is there any thought in Schnekke about getting married
in church; with instinctive surefootedness he recognizes it as a ball and chain
on the leg of his ingenuity, and he manages-despite a series of rather fully de­
veloped erotic relationships-to escape from marriage with the surety of a sleep­
walker. He always remains cognizant of the needs surrounding the free develop­
ment of his uniqueness, and he rightfully invokes Ekkehard in his diary when
he says that marriage would inhibit his essential I-ness. At the same time, we
should not overlook the impressive progress evident from Ferker to Schnekke
when it comes to women. There is no illiterate woman in Schnekke's life, no one
who with petit-bourgeois ridiculousness would claim to restrain genius's needs
for unrestrained activity; no one who would not have been proud to have served
Schnekke as the impetus for his artistic achievements and thus to have enjoyed
the most gratifying reward of her femaleness.Typewriter

screened and ordered, the diaries are presented i n monthly reports to the
chief of the Buribunk Department, who can in this manner continuously su­
pervise the psychological evolution of his province and report to a central
agency. This agency, in turn, keeps a record of the complete register ( and
publishes that register in Esperanto) and is hence in a position to exercise
buribunkological control over all of Buribunkdom. A series of relevant
practices-such as periodic and mutual photo opportunities and film pre­
sentations, an active exchange of diaries, readings from diaries, studio visits,
conferences, new j ournals, theater productions preceded and followed by
laudatios on the personality of the artist-ensure that the interest of the
Buribunk in himself and in the quintessentially Buribunkic does not become
mere decorum; they prevent as well a damaging, countercultural waning of
interest, which leads us to doubt whether the refined existence of the Buri­
bunk world will ever come to an end.
Nevertheless, here too we see a rebellious spirit in evidence, albeit
rarely. And yet it needs to be said that in the Buribunk world, there exists an
unlimited and infinitely understanding tolerance, as well as the highest re­
spect for a person's individual liberty. Buribunks are allowed to write their
diary entries free from any coercion whatsoever. Not only is one allowed to
say that he lacks the mental energy for further entries and that it is only the
grief felt for his failing energies that gives him the energy necessary for fur­
ther entries; that is, in fact, one of the most beloved types of entry, which is
widely acknowledged and appreciated. He can also put down, without fear­
ing the least pressure, that he considers the diary one of the most senseless
and b othersome practices, an annoying chicanery, a ridiculous old hat-in
brief, he is not prevented from using the strongest language. For the Buri­
bunks well know that they would violate the nerve center of their being
were they to mess with the principle of unconditional freedom of speech.
There even exists a reputable organization that sets itself the task of buri­
bunkically recording Anti-Buribunkdom, just as there is an agency created
for the purpose of fostering, in impressive entries, the ability to articulate
disgust and loathing for the agency and even protest against the obligatory
diary entry. Periodically, when diary entries threaten to glide into a certain
uniformity, leaders of the Buribunks organize a successful movement aimed
at raising individual-personal self-esteem. ". The high point of this liberality,
". In this context, certain undaunted neo-Buribunkic initiatives deserve an
honorable mention. They have led to the establishment of a prize-winning ques­
tion that is raised periodically, " What real progress have the Buribunks made
since the days of Ferker? " and to decided efforts in that direction.240
Typewriter
however, resides in the fact that no Buribunk is forbidden from writing in
his diary that he refuses to keep a diary.
Naturally, such freedom does not reach the point of anarchic chaos.
Every entry about refusing to keep a diary must be amply supported and de­
veloped. Whosoever, instead of writing about one's resistance toward writ­
ing, really omits writing altogether violates the general intellectual openness
and will be eliminated on grounds of antisocial behavior. The path of evolu­
tion silently passes over the silent ones; they are outside of all discourse and
as a result can no longer draw attention to themselves. Finally, sinking step
by step until hitting the bottom of the social hierarchy, they are forced to
manufacture the external conditions for the possibility of noble Buribunk­
dom, for example, high-quality, handmade paper, upon which are printed
the most distinguished diaries . . . . That is a rigorous but completely natural
selection of the fittest, for whosoever cannot compete in the intellectual
struggle of diaries will soon degenerate and disappear in the mass of those
equipped only to produce the external conditions just mentioned. As a result
of this physical labor and other menial services, such people also are no
longer in a position to exploit, in Buribunk fashion, each moment of their
lives, and they thus yield to an inexorable fate. Since they don't write any­
more, they cannot respond to possible inconsistencies in their personal file;
they no longer stay current, they disappear from the monthly reports and
become nonentities. As if swallowed by the earth, nobody knows them any­
more, nobody mentions them in their diaries, they are neither seen nor
heard. Regardless of the intensity of their lament, even if it were to drive
them to the edge of insanity, the honorable law does not spare anyone who
has dishonorably excluded him- or herself, just as the laws of natural selec­
tion themselves know no exception.
And so, through tireless and engaged activity, the Buribunks seek to
achieve such a perfection of their organization that, even if only over the
span of hundreds of generations, an unprecedented progression is ensured.
Daunting calculations-may progress not render them utopian!-have sug­
gested that culture will eventually reach such a level that, thanks to unhin­
dered evolution, the ability for diary writing will gradually become inborn
in the Buribunk fetus. If so, fetuses could, with the help of appropriate, yet­
to-be-developed media, communicate with one another about their cardinal
perceptions and hence ( by demystifying the remaining secrets of sex re­
search) provide the necessary, factual basis for a refined sexual ethics. All
that, of course, is far in the distance. It is, however, a historical fact that al­
ready today there exists a grand and densely organized mass of Buribunk­
dom-and hence a speaking, writing, bustling Buribunkdom compelled toTypewriter
24 I
enjoy each person's essential personality-that forges ahead into the sunrise
of historicity.
The basic outline of the philosophy of the Buribunks: I think, therefore
I am; I speak, therefore I am; I write, therefore I am; I publish, therefore I
am. This contains no contradiction, but rather the progressive sequence of
identities, each of which, following the laws of logic, transcends its own
limitations. For Buribunks, thinking is nothing but silent speech; speech is
nothing but writing without script; writing is nothing but anticipated publi­
cation; and publication is, hence, identical with writing to such a degree
that the differences between the two are so small as to be negligible. I write,
therefore I am; I am, therefore I write. What do I write ? I write myself. Who
writes me ? I myself write myself. What do I write about? I write that I write
myself. What is the great engine that elevates me out of the complacent cir­
cle of egohood? History!
I am thus a letter on the typewriter of history. I am a letter that writes
itself. Strictly speaking, however, I write not that I write myself but only the
letter that I am. But in writing, the world spirit apprehends itself through
me, so that I, in turn, by apprehending myself, simultaneously apprehend
the world spirit. I apprehend both it and myself not in thinking fashion,
but-as the deed precedes the thought-in the act of writing. Meaning: I
am not only the reader of world history but also its writer.
At each second of world history, the letters of the typewriter keyboard
leap, impelled by the nimble fingers of the world-I, onto the white paper and
continue the historical narrative. Only at the moment that the single letter,
singled out from the meaningless and senseless indifference of the keyboard,
hits the animated fullness of the white paper, is a historical reality created;
only at that moment does life begin. That is to say, the beginning of the
past, since the present is nothing but the midwife that delivers the lived, his­
torical past out of the dark womb of the future. As long as it is not reached,
the future is as dull and indifferent as the keyboard of the typewriter, a dark
rat hole from which one second after the other, just like one rat after the
other, emerges into the light of the past.
Ethically speaking, what does the Buribunk do who keeps a diary each
and every second of his life ? He wrests each second off of the future in or­
der to integrate it into history. Let us imagine this procedure in all its mag­
nificence: second by second, the blinking young rat of the present moment
crawls out of the dark rat hole of the future-out of the nothing that not
yet is-in order to merge (eyes glowing with fiery anticipation) the next sec­
ond with the reality of history. Whereas with the unintellectual human be­
ing, millions and billions of rats rush without plan or goal out into the infi-242
Typewriter
nite expanse of the past only to lose themselves in it, the diary-keeping Buri­
bunk can catch each of those seconds, one at a time, and-once aligned in
an orderly battalion-allow them to demonstrate the parade of world his­
tory. This way, he secures for both himself and humanity the maximum
amount of historical facticity and cognizance. This way, the nervous antici­
pation of the future is defused, for no matter what happens, one thing is for
sure: no second peeling off of the future is getting lost, no hit of the type­
writer key will miss the page.
The death of an individual is also nothing but such a rat second, which
has no content in itself-whether one of happiness or grief-but only in its
historical registration. Of course, in the rat second of my death, I can no
longer hold pen and diary, and I am ostensibly no longer actively involved in
this historical registration; the crux of diary keeping, the will to power over
history, disappears and clears the field for somebody else's desire. If we dis­
regard the pedagogical aspects of this situation, that is, its application not to
waste a second in order to impose our will to power onto historiography in
the making, we must confess that the termination of our will to history goes
very much against our will, for the will to power in the first instance always
refers to the will to one's own p ower, not to that of a certain historian of fu­
ture generations. Such concerns, however, lend themselves to serious confu­
sion, and we have already seen how even in the case of the great Ferker, the
fear of death had a downright catastrophic influence on his historical repu­
tation. Today, however, thanks to the evolving consciousness whose sunlight
kills the bacteria of the fear of death, there is little danger of any confusion
among the Buribunks.
We see through the illusion of uniqueness. We are the letters produced
by the writing hand of the world spirit and surrender ourselves consciously
to this writing p ower. In that we recognize true freedom. In that we also see
the means of putting ourselves into the position of the world spirit. The in­
dividual letters and words are only the tools of the ruses of world history.
More than one recalcitrant " no " that has been thrown into the text of his­
tory feels proud of its opposition and thinks of itself as a revolutionary, even
though it may only negate revolution itself. But by consciously merging with
the writing of world history we comprehend its spirit, we become equal to
it, and-without ceasing to be written-we yet understand ourselves as
writing subjects. That is how we outruse the ruse of world history-namely,
by writing it while it writes us.17oTypewriter

World history comes to a close as a global typewriters' association. Digi­
tal signal processing (DSP) can set in. Its promotional euphemism, post­
history, only barely conceals that war is the beginning and end of all arti­
ficial intelligence.
In order to supersede world history (made from classified intelligence
reports and literary processing protocols), the media system proceeded in
three phases. Phase I , beginning with the American Civil War, developed
storage technologies for acoustics, optics, and script: film, gramophone,
and the man-machine system, typewriter. Phase 2, beginning with the
First World War, developed for each storage content appropriate electric
transmission technologies: radio, television, and their more secret coun­
terparts. Phase 3 , since the Second World War, has transferred the sche­
matic of a typewriter to a technology of predictability per se; Turing's
mathematical definition of computability in 193 6 gave future computers
their name.
Storage technology from 19 1 4 to 19 1 8 meant deadlocked trench war­
fare from Flanders to Gallipoli. Transmission technology with VHF tank
communications and radar images, those military developments parallel
to television,171 meant total mobilization, motorization, and blitzkrieg
from the Vistula in 1939 to Corregidor in 194 5 . And finally, the largest
computer program of all time, the conflation of test run with reality, goes
by the name of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Storing/transmitting/cal­
culating, or trenches/ blitz/stars. World wars from I to n.
In artificial intelligences, all media glamor vanishes and goes back to
basics. (After all, "glamor" is nothing but a Scottish corruption of the
word "grammar. " ) 172 Bits reduced the seeming continuity of optical me­
dia and the real continuity of acoustic media to letters, and these letters
to numbers. DSP stores, transfers, calculates-millions of times per sec­
ond, it runs through the three functions necessary and sufficient for me­
dia. The standard for today's microprocessors, from the point of view of
their hardware, is simply their systematic integration.
Calculations are performed by a central processing unit ( CPU) that,
in the case of Zilog's Z80 microprocessor, cannot do much more than
manipulate blocks of 8 bits either logically (following Boolean algebra)
or arithmetically (through basic addition). Storage is subdivided into a
Read-Only Memory ( ROM), which retains once and for all inscribed
data, preferably commands and computing constants, and a Random Ac­
cess Memory ( RAM), which reads the variable data of a measured envi­
ronment and returns mathematical data to control that environment. The
exchange between individual modules runs along uni- or bidirectional244
Typewriter

busses (for data, addresses, and control commands such as WRITE or
READ ), and the transfer from and to the environment runs via an in­
put/output port (110) at whose outer margin, finally, the conversion of
continuities into bits takes place.
And since, from the microprocessor to large processing networks,
everything is nothing but a modular vice, the three basic functions of stor­
ing/transferring/processing are replicated on internal levels no longer ac­
cessible to programmers. For its part, the CPU includes ( I ) an arithmetic
logic unit (ALU), (2) several RAMs or registers to store variables and a
ROM to store microprograms, and ( 3 ) internal busses to transfer data,
addresses, and control commands to the system's busses.
That's all. But with sufficient integration and repetition, the modular
system is capable of processing, that is, converting into any possible me­
dium, each individual time particle of the data received from any envi­
ronment. As if one could reconstruct, custom-made from one microsec­
ond to the next, a complete recording studio comprising reel-to-reels plus
radio transmission plus control panel and switchboard. Or, as if the Buri­
bunks' immense permeation with data coincided with an automated Buri­
bunkology that could be switched, at the speed of electrical current, from
a register of data to a register of persons or even their self-registration.
The construction of the Golem, at any rate, is perfect. The storage media
of the founding generation were only capable of replacing the eye and the
ear, the sensorium of the central nervous system; the communications me­
dia between the two wars were only capable of replacing the mouth and
the hand, the motorics of information. Which is why, behind all registers,Typewriter

all channels, a human being still appeared to be doing the transmitting.
So-called thinking remained thinking; it therefore could not be imple­
mented. For that, thinking or speech had to be completely converted into
computing.
"
I WILL LEARN HOW TO COMPUTE ON MY TYPEWRITER, " writes an in­
mate of Gugging (on his red device for this red and black book). Alan
Turing did nothing else. Instead of learning his public school's prescribed
handwriting, he reduced typewriters to their bare principle: first, storing
or writing; second, spacing or transferring; third, reading (formerly re­
served for secretaries) or computing discrete data, that is, block letters
and figures. Rather than conclude that humans are superior, as did his
colleague Godel, with whom he j ointly refuted the Hilbert program (in
support of a complete, consistent, and decidable mathematics, that is, a
mathematics that could in principle be delegated to machines),173 Turing
was suicidal-in life as well as in his j ob. He dropped the unpredictable
in order to relieve mathematicians of all predictable (or recursive) func­
tions and to construct the machine that Hilbert had presumed as a for­
malism. The hypothetical determinism of a Laplacian universe, with its
humanist loopholes ( 1 795), was replaced by the factual predictability of
finite-state machines. Rather full of pride, Turing wrote:
The prediction which we are considering is, however, rather nearer to practicabil­
ity than considered by Laplace. The system of the "universe as a whole" is such24 6
Typewriter
that quite small errors in the initial conditions can have an overwhelming effect
at a later time. The displacement of a single electron by a billionth of a centime­
tre at one moment might make the difference between a man being killed by an
avalanche a year later, or escaping. It is an essential property of the mechanical
systems which we have called " discrete state machines" that this phenomenon
does not occur. Even when we consider the actual physical machines instead of
the idealised machines, reasonably accurate knowledge of the state at one mo­
ment yields reasonably accurate knowledge any number of steps laterY4
The overwhelming effects of this predictability have since reached
Man's employment statistics. The consequences of Turing's politics of sui­
cide: "As Victorian technology had mechanised the work of the artisans,
the computer of the future would automate the trade of intelligent think­
ing . . . . The craft jealously displayed by human experts only delighted
him. In this way he was an anti-technocrat, subversively diminishing the
authority of the new priests and magicians of the world. He wanted to
make intellectuals into ordinary people. " 175
The first to be affected were of course stenotypists. After eleven years,
Turing's Universal Discrete Machine fulfilled the prophecy that an appa­
ratus " also renders superfluous the typist. " His simulation game, in
which a censor is to but cannot actually decide which of two data sources
A and B is human and which is a machine, significantly has a precursor.
According to Turing, computer B replaces the systemic position of a
woman who -in competition or gender war with a man A-seeks to per­
suade the data gap C that she is the real woman. But since both voices are
severed from the "written, or, better still, typed" flow of information,
Remington's secretary gives her farewell performance. Whenever trans­
vestite A insists that he has strands of hair "nine inches long," the human
predecessor of the computer writes to her censor, as mechanically as fu­
tilely, " I am the woman, don't listen to him ! " 176
With which the homosexual Turing raised to the level of technology
Dionysus's sentence, "Must we not first hate ourself if we are to love our­
self? " With the added observation that against total desexualization,
protest will " avail nothing." 177 Computers write by themselves, without
secretaries, simply with the command WRITE. (Anyone who would like
to see the phallus in the 5 volts of a logical I , and the hole in the 0.7 volts
of an 0, confuses industrial standards with fiction.) Only those intersec­
tions between computers and their environment that, following ASCII
code (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), are net­
worked bit by bit with typewriter keys178 will continue to offer women
jobs for a while. When ENIAC, "the first operational computer," accord-Typewriter

ing to misleading American accounts, calculated projectile trajectories
and A-bomb pressure waves during the Second World War, one hundred
women were hired in addition to male programmers. Their j ob: "to climb
around on ENIAC's massive frame, locate burnt-out vacuum tubes, hook
up cables, and perform other types of work unrelated to writing. " 179
By contrast, Turing, with an eye toward "computers and guided pro­
jectiles, " predicted good times for men, programmers, and mathemati­
cians.180 But it was a strange kind of mathematics into which he imported
the elegance and complexity of classical analysis. What disappeared in
the split-up of binaries was not only the continuity of all graphs and tra­
jectories examined since Leibniz, and which Fourier's theory and Edison's
phonographs simply followed. What was much more drastic than such
primitive step functions was his crucial innovation: the abolition of the
difference between numbers and operational symbols, data and com­
mands. For even if numbers stood for data relationships, the signs + or ­
were still inhabited by a human spirit who appeared to give the command
to add or subtract. Turing's Universal Discrete Machine, however, con­
verted these (and all other) letters into their monotonous rows of bina­
ries. In machine language, the command ADD is neither a human enun­
ciation nor a letter symbol, but just one of many series of bits. (In a Z80,
the command "Increase the number in the accumulator by 2" would be
I lOO O l IO / 0000 0010. ) It was not G6del's humanist belief but rather his
simple trick of Godelization that once again emerged victorious: only af­
ter commands, axioms, or, to put it briefly, sentences had been converted
into numbers were they as infinitely manipulable as numbers. End of lit­
erature, which is made up of sentences.
Every microprocessor implements through software what was once
the dream of the cabala; namely, that through their encipherment and the
manipulation of numbers, letters could yield results or illuminations that
no reader could have found. Computers are endless series of numbers
only whose relative position decides whether they operate as (verbal)
commands or (numeric) data or addresses. If John von Neumann, the
mathematician of the Second World War, had not taken certain precau­
tions for his machines, a command sequence of numbers such as ADD
could also add up, aside from the usual data, command sequences them­
selves, until no programmer would be able to comprehend the starry
mathematics to which that take-off had abducted their computer.
The neat separation of data, addresses, commands-that is, of stor­
age contents, points of transfer, and processing steps-by contrast, as­
sures that for each address, there is only one command or datum on the248
Typewriter
bus. A box of numbered paper slips that can log on not only (as with the
Buribunks) to certain books, chapters, pages, terms, but to any individual
bit of the system. Computer algorithms, instead of simply reproducing a
logic, consist of "LOGIC + CONTROL. " 181 No wonder that govern­
mental ingenuity invented the impossible job of the data security special­
ist to camouflage the precision of such data control.
On the other hand, since Turing, the possible job of a programmer
has run the risk of forgetting mathematical elegance. Today, prior to the
conquest of digital signal processors, the hardware of average computers
is at a kindergarten level: of all the basic forms of computation, it barely
manages addition. More complex commands have to be reconverted into
a finite, that is, serial, number of cumulative steps. An unreasonable
chore for humans and mathematicians. Where recursive, that is, automa­
tizable, functions succeed classical analysis, computation works as a
treadmill: through the repeated application of the same command on the
series of interim results. But that's it. A Hungarian mathematician, after
he had filled two whole pages with the recursive formulas according to
which a Turing machine progresses from I to 2 to 3 , and so on, observed
in German as twisted as it was precise: "This appears as an extraordinar­
ily slowed-down film shot of the computation processes of man. If this
mechanism of computation is applied to some functions, you start living
it, you begin to compute exactly like it, only faster. " 182 Consolation for
prospective programmers . . .
Slow-motion shots of the spirit will exorcise it. Chopped up like
movements in front of the camera, equations finally solve themselves
without intuition because every discrete step during storage, transfer, and
calculation takes place with bureaucratic precision. The discrete machine
forms a solitary union with cinema and typewriter, but not with neuro­
physiology. That is what distinguishes it from the dream typewriter con­
structed by Friedlaender's Dr. Sucram, who in his main line of work took
care of the Gray Magic [Graue Magie 1 of three-dimensional cinema.
The doctor concentrated on his experiments with a curious little machine model.
He put a metal helmet on his head; fine wires connected the helmet to the key­
board of the typewriter. Without any movement on the doctor's part, the levers of
the machine started moving. It was a ghostly sight to behold.
" What kind of a device is that? " [BosemannJ pointed to the helmet from
which emerged the wires connecting to the keyboard.
"An extraordinarily comfortable typewriter, Mister Bosemann. It saves me a
typist. I am in the process of letting the ethereal emanations of the brain work for
me directly. Up to now, our thoughts, no matter how practical, have been movingTypewriter
249
the world only in indirect ways. Our machines do not yet work under the direct
influence of our thoughts, our will. I plan a direct transmission. " ! 83
The typing, computing, and sewing machines in the brains or books
of Nietzsche and KuRmaul hence became reality. The founding myth of a
media landscape, which would only be the worldwide unfolding of neu­
rophysiology, reached its peak in Friedlaender's machine fiction. Fourteen
years later, it ends in Turing's machine, which was also never built but is
mathematically conceivable. The computer and the brain are functionally
compatible, but not in terms of their schematics. Since the nervous sys­
tem, according to Turing, is "certainly not a discrete-state machine," that
is, not infinitesimally precise, all the unpredictabilities of a Laplacian uni­
verse loom over it.184 Thus, "the real importance of the digital procedure
lies in its ability to reduce the computational noise level to an extent
which is completely unobtainable by any other (analogy) procedure. "
And even if-following Neumann's elegant simplification-the neural,
but not the hormonal, conduits operate according to a digital model, their
information flow is still five thousand times slower than that of comput­
ers. 18S The brain, however, compensates for this loss of transmission
through the parallel processing of whole sets of data; statistical breadth
(presumably based on majority gates) for which computers can compen­
sate only through serial processing and recursive functions. What remains
unrealized, at any rate, is Dr. Sucram's desire for "letting the ethereal em­
anations of the brain work for me directly. "
The white noise of brains, of the ether, of the globe: the total type­
writer has nothing to do with that. But everything to do with trenches/
blitz/stars.
Even if "there is little in our technological or physiological experience
to indicate that absolute all-or-none organs exist," 1 86 the oldest knowl­
edge of gods, ghosts, and generals knows better. The language of the up­
per echelons of leadership is always digital. In the scriptures of the priests,
Yahweh distinguishes for seven days between day and night, morning and
evening, sun and moon, earth and heaven, land and water (not to mention
good and bad). That is what the priests, who have edited and continue to
administer this holy scripture, call God's creation. But "it is nothing but
the creation of nothing other than signifiers. "187 Earth and heaven can do
without Elohim's inscription; it exists, prior to God's creation and after
God's death, in another holiness, for which the Holy Bible only has the
word tohu bohu: 1 88 the random noise of events. The language of the up­
per echelons of leadership, by contrast, is digitalization; it transforms250
Typewriter
sources of accidental noise into absolute all-or-none organs. Otherwise,
commands and censures, those two anti symmetrical instruments of lead­
ership, could not be communicated.
And if the invading of communication channels by scrambling noises
makes it necessary, the language of the upper echelons goes so far as to
overcode the binary opposition with another, that is, redundant, binary
opposition. In the German General Staff,
a military language practice that was exercised and used for decades . . . aimed
strictly at distinguishing between "western" and " eastward " in military briefs
and reports. The reason was that one wanted to establish a distinct sound differ­
ence between the two terms, because otherwise messages and dictates delivered
orally or over the phone might easily have resulted in fateful mix-ups . . . . The
layman might think of this as a triviality, but every soldier is surely cognizant of
the far-reaching implications of this regulation.
For planning wars on two fronts, the opposition between east and west is
as fundamental as that between heaven and earth for the gods of creation.
Therefore, when Maj or General Alfred JodI, the last chief of an illustri­
ous short (hi)story, "used the word 'eastern' rather than, as was common
protocol, 'eastward' in an army report of June 14, 1940, during the west­
ern offensive of 1940 . . . even though he himself had emerged from the
ranks of the army . . . he violated without much ado a time-tested prac­
tice and triggered widespread and intense indignation in the officers'
corps. " 189
The tohu bohu and, in its wake, analog media run through all the
various types of conditions except the NO. 1 90 Computers are not emana­
tions of nature. Rather, the universal discrete machine, with its ability to
erase, negate, and oppose binary signs, always already speaks the lan­
guage of the upper echelons. On the transmitting side, the general staffs
of the Axis, just as, on the receiving end, those in London or Washington.
Whether or NOT the Japanese empire took seriously the resource em­
bargo threatened by Roosevelt (that is, attack the United States), whether
or NOT Vice Admiral Nagumo's flotilla would sink the Pacific battleships
at Pearl Harbor with carrier-bound aircraft, whether or NOT he would
maintain silence in his areas of operation off the Aleutian Islands (he did):
these were precisely the digital puzzles of 194 1 , solvable only through the
interception and decoding of necessarily discrete sources of information.
And since the machine mathematics of the current century endowed gen­
eral staffs with the ability to encrypt their orders automatically, that is,Typewriter
25 1
immeasurably more efficiently than by hand, decoding had to be done by
machines as well. The Second World War: the birth of the computer from
the spirit of Turing and his never-built principal relay.
This escalation between senders and receivers, weapons and anti­
weapons, is told quickly and most precisely in the words of Guglielmo
Marconi, which were broadcast from a gramophone record on Radio
Roma by the inventor of the radio immediately after his death (as if to un­
derscore the new acoustic immortality) . Marconi, a senator and marchese
of fascist Italy, "confessed" that
forty-two years ago, when I achieved the first successful wireless transmission in
Pontecchio, I already anticipated the possibility of transmitting electric waves
over large distances, but in spite of that I could not hope for the great satisfaction
I am enjoying today. For in those days a major shortcoming was ascribed to
my invention: the possible interception of transmissions. This defect preoccupied
me so much that, for many years, my principal research was focused on its
elimination.
Thirty years later, however, precisely this defect was exploited and turned
into radio-into that medium of reception that now reaches more than 40 million
listeners every day.l9l
Which unnamed circles feared the interception of transmissions is not
hard to guess. Which circles charged Marconi with the elimination of this
defect, that is, with the construction of a wooden iron, is even easier to
guess. Nothing in the analog medium of the radio allows the negation of
signals, their spy-proof inversion into their opposite, or nonsense. Hence,
general staffs, who were afforded perfect communication to the front and
possibilities for blitzkrieg by Marconi's invention, had to rely on the de­
velopment of discrete encoding machines. Immensely inflated flows of in­
formation demanded a form of text processing as automatic as it was dis­
crete -the typewriter.
Since 19 19, the engineer Arthur Scherb ius had experimented in Berlin­
Wilmersdorf with a "secret typewriter. " In 1923, he himself thus founded
Chiffriermaschinen A.G. (Encoding Machines Corporation) and secured

typewriter key, the rotors (just like the second, minute, and hour hands of
clocks) advanced by one revolution, only to return to their original posi­
tion not until 267 , or 8 billion, hits later.
That is how Scherbius, with his machine mathematics, liberated cryp­
tographers from their manual work. The sender, instead of having to la­
bor for hours with pencil, tables, and graph paper, sat in front of a regu-Typewriter
253
lar typewriter keyboard and typed in the orders o f his general staff in
plain text. The letter output, however, which he could read from the
flashing of 26 bulbs and which he copied in accordingly, looked like pure
letter salad. Radio as well, with its large defect, could translate that salad
in spy-proof fashion, until an antisymmetrical, secret typewriter on the
receiving end converted the almost perfect white noise back into plain
text, simply because the machine was calibrated on the basis of a daily
command to start at the same rotor.
Year after year since the First World War, the German army had torpe­
doed Bredow's plans to set up a civilian radio network, despite all the
horror of a communist radio specter and the abuse of army equipment.
Its own information flow, especially on long wave, was given priority. In
November I9 22, however, postal secretary Bredow could inform the
Ministry of Defense that "the switch of the official radio services to wire­
less telegraphy and the use of encoding machines would soon provide suf­
ficient security to protect the privacy of telegraphy. " 193 That's how pre­
cisely information was exchanged between industry and the state. In
I92 3 , General von Seeckt also granted radio entertainment to Germans,
but not without prohibiting with draconian regulations any misuse of
civilian receivers for purposes of transmission. But the order of discourses
in the current century was restored: a few public transmission frequencies
thus permitted (to the joy of literary and media sociologists) the mass re­
ception that Marconi posthumously welcomed; Scherbius, however, pre­
vented the interception of the military-industrial complex's numerous fre­
quencies, which Marconi was worried about. Since then, people have
been doused in the glamor of analog media only to remove the grammar
of the typewriter, the prototype of digital information processing, from
their minds.
In I9 26, the German navy used the first encryption machines. 194
Three years later, soon after Major Fellgiebel, the subsequent chief of
Army Communications, had taken over the Abwehr's cryptography divi­
sion,195 the army followed. The secret typewriter of Wilmersdorf was
equipped with yet more secret rotors, as well as the name of secrecy itself:
ENIGMA. For a decade, it lived up to that name.
But other states also did their shopping at Scherbius. Modified
Enigma models were the standard between the world wars. All classified
exchanges between Tokyo and the Japanese embassy in the United States
(including all the planning for Pearl Harbor), for example, took place in
the machine code Angooki Taipu B, which the American counterpart re-General Guderian on the Enigma in his general's tank.Typewriter

named Purple for reasons of security. l96 Three months prior to Vice Ad­
miral Nagumo's blitzkrieg, William F. Friedman, chief of the Signal Intel­
ligence School ( SIS ), pulled a cryptoanalytical stunt. In mathematical pu­
rity, that is, without having captured and subsequently evaluated a Purple
code (following the black-box rules of the Second World War), he man­
aged to retrace the infinite permutations of the secret typewriter. The last
victory of humans over communication technologies, which Friedman
paid for with a nervous collapse and months of psychiatric treatment. 197
But as always, it was precisely at the site of madness that machines orig­
inated. Their superhuman computation capability allowed the U.S. pres­
ident to listen in on Japan's plans for attack. That Roosevelt allegedly did
not warn his two commanding air and sea officers in the Pacific is an al­
together different story . . .
The escalation of weapons and antiweapons, of cryptography and
cryptoanalysis (as Friedman renamed writing and reading under the con­
ditions of high technology), at any rate urgently required the automatiza­
tion of decoding. And for that need, a universal discrete machine, which
could replace any other machine, was a perfect fit. "The most compli­
cated machines are made only with words . " 198 Turing, soon after nega­
tively solving Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) , de­
scribed to his mother "a possible application" of the new and seemingly
infinite mathematics at which he was
working on at present. It answers the question " What is the most general kind of
code or cipher possible," and at the same time (rather naturally) enables me to
construct a lot of particular and interesting codes. One of them is pretty well im­
possible to decode without a key, and very quick to encode. I expect I could sell
them to H.M. Government for quite a substantial sum, but I am rather doubtful
about the morality of such things. What do you think?199
The answer came not from his mother but from the government. Ger­
many's "Enigma machine was the central problem that confronted the
British Intelligence Service in 193 8 . But they believed it was unsolv­
able,"20o until the Government Code and Cipher School hired Alan M.
Turing (notwithstanding his moral doubts) three days after the outbreak
of the war.
Bletchley Park, the bombproof site of British cryptoanalysis during
the war, was in a better position than its American colleagues: young
mathematicians of the Polish secret service had already constructed a de­
coding machine, the so-called Bombe, based on captured Enigmas. But
when Fellgiebel's Army Communications increased the number of rotors256
Typewriter
to five, even the Bombe could not follow suit. The I 5 0,738,274,937,250
possible ways of electrically connecting ten pairs of letters exceeded its
capacity, at least in real time, on which blitzkrieg commands and their
timely countermeasures depend. The overwhelmed Poles donated their
files to the British and Turing.
From this primitive Bombe, Turing made a machine that the head of
Bletchley Park not coincidentally named the Oriental Goddess: a fully au­
tomatized oracle to interpret fully automatized secret radio communica­
tion. Turing's recursive functions laid the groundwork for the enemy's
ability to decode Enigma signals with a mere 24-hour delay beginning in
May I94 I , and thus, to paraphrase Goebbels, to eavesdrop on the enemy.
The German army did not want to believe it until the end of the war: it
was "fully convinced that the decoding of Enigma was, even with the aid
of captured machines, impossible given the overwhelmingly large number
of calibrating positions. "201 However, only nonsense, white noise without
information and hence of no use for the upper echelons, provides com­
plete proof against spying. Whereas "the very fact that the Enigma was a
machine made mechanical cryptoanalysis a possibility. " 202 As a pseudo­
random generator, the secret typewriter produced nonsense only relative
to systems whose revolutions did not match its own. Turing's goddess,
however, found regularities in the letter salad.
For one thing, Enigma had the practical advantage or theoretical dis­
advantage that its cipher consisted of a self-inverse group. In order to be
encoded or decoded on the same machine, letter pairs had to be inter­
changeable. For example, when the OKW encoded its 0 as a K, the K in­
versely turned into an O. From that followed "the very particular feature
that no letter could be enciphered by itself. " 203 Not even the OKW was
capable of writing its own name. Turing subjected these few yet revealing
implications to a sequential analysis that weighted and controlled all the
probabilities of solution. With automatized judgment, the Oriental God­
dess ran through permutation after permutation, until the letter salad be­
came plain text again. War of typewriters.
And since from " I 5 to a maximum of 29 percent"204 of the German
radio traffic ran through Enigma, the spy war reached a new level: inter­
ception yielded "not just messages, but the whole enemy communication
system. " 205 The midrange levels of command-from army and division
headquarters to individual blitzkrieg weapons on land, in the air, or at
sea-betrayed their addresses, which are, all spy novels notwithstanding,
more revealing than data or messages. Sixty different Enigma codes and
3 ,000 classified radio messages per day, with all of the specs for theirTypewriter
257
senders and receivers, recorded the war like a typewriter the size o f Eu­
rope. Under the conditions of high technology, war coincides with a chart
of its organizational structure. Reason enough for the Government Code
and Cipher School to model, in miniature, its organization after that of
the German army, that is, after the enemy. 206 Turing's game of imitation
became a reality.
It is only one step from the flowchart to the computer. The addresses,
data, commands that circulated between humans and typewriters in the
German army or its British simulacrum could finally turn into hardware.
This last step was undertaken in I943 by the Post Office Research Station
at Bletchley Park. One thousand five hundred tubes were expropriated
and converted into overloaded switches and, instead of reinforcing radio
analog signals, simulated the binary play of Boolean algebra. Transistors
did not make it into the world until I949, but even without them the uni­
versal discrete machine -including data entry, programming possibilities,
and the great innovation of internal storage mechanisms207-saw its first
implementation, for which Turing's successors could find no other name
than COLOSSUS. Because the strategic secrets of the Fuhrer's headquar­
ters, Wolfsschanze, could, as is logical, only be cracked by a monster
computer.
COLOSSUS began its work and decoded an additional 40 percent of
the German radio traffic- everything that for reasons of security was
transmitted not via Enigma and wireless but via the Siemens Cryptwriter.
As a teleprinter running the Baudot-Murray Code, this typewriter no
longer required cumbersome manual operation with its human sources of
error; its fully digitized signals consisted of the "yes " or "no" of ticker258
Typewriter
tape, which, through the binary addition of plain text and pseudo­
random generator, could be encoded much more efficiently than with
Enigma. Moreover, radio interception became possible only once signals
were sent through a radio link rather than a telegraph cable.20s That is
how well upper echelons pick their typewriters.
Obviously, COLOSSUS beat binary addition with binary addition,
but even the first computer in the history of science or warfare would
have been nothing but a several-ton version of Remington's special type­
writer with a calculating machine209 had it not observed conditional jump
instructions.21o
Conditional jumps, first envisioned in Babbage's unfinished Analyti­
cal Engine of 1 83 5 , were born into the world of machines in 193 8 in Kon­
rad Zuse's apartment in Berlin, and this world has since been self-identi­
cal with the symbolic. In vain, the autodidact offered his binary calcula­
tors to use as encryption machines and to surpass the supposedly
spy-proof Enigma.2 l 1 The opportunity missed by Army Communications
was seized by the German Aviation Test Site in 194 1-for the purposes of
"calculating, testing, and examining cruise missiles. " 212 Yet Zuse made
only the most sparing use of the IF-THEN commands of his brilliant
"plan calculation" : Godel's and Turing's insight of translating commands,
that is, letters, into numbers was a concern for him:
Since programs, like numbers, are built from series of bits, it was only a matter of
course that programs be stored as well. With that it was possible to make condi­
tional jumps, as we say today, and to convert addresses. From the point of view of
schematics, there are several solutions for it. They all rest on a common thought:
the feedback of the result of the calculation on the process and on the configura­
tion of the program itself. Symbolically, one can envision that through a single
wire. I was, frankly, nervous about taking that step. As long as that wire has not
been laid, computers can easily be overseen and controlled in their possibilities
and effects. But once unrestricted program processing becomes a possibility, it is
difficult to recognize the point at which one could say: up to this point, but no
further. 2 J3
A simple feedback loop -and information machines bypass humans,
their so-called inventors. Computers themselves become subjects. IF a
preprogrammed condition is missing, data processing continues accord­
ing to the conventions of numbered commands, but IF somewhere an in­
termediate result fulfills the condition, THEN the program itself deter­
mines successive commands, that is, its future.
In the same way, Lacan, making a distinction with animal codes, de-Typewriter
259
fined language and subjectivity a s human properties. For example, the
dance of bees, as it has been researched by von Frisch, "is distinguished
from language precisely by the fixed correlation of its signs to the reality
that they signify. " While the messages of one bee control the flight of an­
other to blossoms and prey, these messages are not decoded and trans­
mitted by the second bee. By contrast, "the form in which language is ex­
pressed . . . itself defines subjectivity. Language says: ' You will go here,
and when you see this, you will turn off there.' In other words: it refers
itself to the discourse of the other. " 214
In yet other words: bees are projectiles, and humans, cruise missiles.
One is given objective data on angles and distances by a dance, the other,
a command of free will. Computers operating on IF-THEN commands
are therefore machine subjects. Electronics, a tube monster since Bletchley
Park, replaces discourse, and programmability replaces free will.
Not for nothing was Zuse "frankly, nervous " about his algorithmic
golems and their " halting problem. " Not for nothing did the Henschel
Works or the Ministry of Aviation assign the development of cruise mis­
siles to these golems . On all fronts, from top-secret cryptoanalysis to the
most spectacular future weapons offensive, the Second World War de­
volved from humans and soldiers to machine subjects. And it wasn't by
much that Zuse's binary computers missed doing the programming of
free space flight from its inception, rather than determining in the bunkers
of the Harz the fate of the V2 at the last moment.215 The " range of
charges" that the Peenemiinde Army Test Site assigned to German uni­
versities in 1939 included (aside from acceleration integrators, Doppler
radar, onboard calculators, etc.), in a rather visionary way, what Wernher
von Braun described as "the first attempt at electric digital computa­
tion."216 The weapon as subject required a corresponding brain.
But since the commander in chief of the German army (whom Syber­
berg has called the " greatest filmmaker of all time " )217 did not believe
in self-guided weapons on the actual rocket testing site, but only during
their demonstration on color film at the Wolfsschanze,218 the entropies
of the Nazi state emerged victorious over information and information
machines.
At any rate, cybernetics, the theory of self-guidance and feedback
loops, is a theory of the Second World War. Norbert Wiener testified to
that when he introduced the term:
The deciding factor in this new step was the war. I had known for a considerable
time that if a national emergency should come, my function in it [sic] would be260
Typewriter
determined largely by two things: my close contact with the program of comput­
ing machines developed by Dr. Vannevar Bush, and my own joint work with Dr.
Yuk Wing Lee on the design of electric networks . . . . At the beginning of the war,
the German prestige in aviation and the defensive position of England turned the
attention of many scientists to the improvement of anti-aircraft artillery. Even be­
fore the war, it had become clear that the speed of the airplane had rendered ob­
solete all classical methods of the direction of fire, and that it was necessary to
build into the control apparatus all the computations necessary. These were ren­
dered much more difficult by the fact that, unlike all previously encountered tar­
gets, an airplane has a velocity which is a very appreciable part of the velocity of
the missile used to bring it down. Accordingly, it is exceedingly important to
shoot the missile, not at the target, but in such a way that missile and target may
come together in space at some time in the future. We must hence find some
method of predicting the future position of the plane. 21 9
With Wiener's Linear Prediction Code (LPC), mathematics changed
into an oracle capable of predicting a probable future even out of chaos­
initially for fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft guidance systems, in between
the wars for human mouths and the computer simulations of their dis­
courses.220 Blind, unpredictable time, which rules over analog storage and
transmission media (in contrast to the arts), was finally brought under
control. With digital signal processing, measuring circuits and algorithms
(like an automated sound engineer) ride along on random frequencies. To­
day this form of cybernetics ensures the sound of most reputable rock
bands; in actuality, however, it was only a "new step" in ballistics. Ma­
chines replaced Leibniz in the analysis of trajectories.
With the consequence that COLOSSUS gave birth to many a son,
each more colossal than its secret father. According to the ministry of
supply, Turing'S postwar computer ACE was supposed to calculate
"grenades, bombs, rockets, and cruise missiles " ; the American ENIAC
"was to simulate trajectories of shells through varying conditions of air
resistance and wind velocity, which involved the summation of thousands
of little pieces of trajectories." John von Neumann's EDVAC was being
designed to solve "three-dimensional 'aerodynamic and shock-wave prob­
lems, . . . shell, bomb and rocket work, . . . [and] progress in the field of
propellants and high explosives"'; BINAC worked for the United States
Air Force; ATLAS, for cryptoanalysis; and finally, MANIAC, if this sug­
gestive name had been implemented in time, would have optimized the
pressure wave of the first H-bomb.221
Machines operating on the basis of recursive functions produce slow­
motion studies not only of human thinking but also of human demise.Typewriter
261
According to the insight o f Pynchon and Virilio, the blitzkrieg and the
flash-bulb shot (Blitzlichtaufnahme) coincide in the bomb that leveled
Hiroshima during rush hour on August 6, 194 5 . A shutter speed of
0.000000067 seconds, far below Mach's projectile-like, pioneering cine­
matic feat of 1 8 83 , melted countless Japanese people " as a fine-vapor de­
posit of fat-cracklings wrinkled into the fused rubble" of their city.222 Cin­
ema to be computed in computer processing speeds, and only in computer
processing speeds.
On the film's manifest surface, everything proceeds as if the "mar­
riage of two monsters" 223 that John von Neumann had arranged between
a German guided missile and an American A-bomb payload (that is, by
saving both conventional amatol and conventional bomber pilots) by it­
self had been the step from blitzkrieg to the strategic present. What
speaks against that is that both guided missiles and nuclear weapons sur­
mounted the iron and bamboo curtains with extraordinary ease -partly
through espionage, partly through the transfer of technology. Different
from the machine subject itself, the innocuous but fully automated type­
computing machine. With the fiat of the theory that is omnipotent be­
cause it is true, Stalin condemned the bourgeois aberration of cybernetics.
As if materialism, in the espionage races with its other half, had been
blinded by the disclosed secrets of mass extermination, the smoke trail of
rockets and the flash of bombs.
Annihilation is still called determining the outcome of the war. Only
40 years later, classified archives have gradually revealed that Bletchley
Park was presumably the most suitable candidate for this title. During the
Second World War, a materialist who materialized mathematics itself
emerged victorious. Regarding COLOSSUS and Enigma, Turing's biogra­
pher writes that "intelligence had won the war" 224 with the British liter­
ality that does not distinguish among reason, secret service, and informa­
tion machine. But that is exactly what remained a state secret. During the
war, a whole organization emerged for the purpose of delivering the re­
sults of fully automatized cryptoanalysis in coded form to the command­
ing officers at the front. Otherwise, the most vital secret of the war
(through seized documents, traitors, or treacherously revealing counter­
measures) possibly would have filtered through to the German army, and
Enigma would have been silenced. Hence it became secret agents' last his­
torical assignment to invent radiant spy novels in order to camouflage the
fact that interception and the type-computing machine respectively ren­
der secret services and agents superfluous. ( Which is what spy novels con­
tinue to do to this very day.) The mysterious " Werther," who allegedly262

Hiroshima before and after August 6, I94 5 .
transmitted many plans of attack from the Wolfsschanze via Swiss dou­
ble agents to Moscow, but who has yet to be located historically, may well
have been one of the simulacra that systematically screened Bletchley
Park from the Red Army. 225 Then, at any rate, Stalin's theory would have
had a material basis-nonproliferation of the flow of information.
On August 28, 194 5 , three weeks after Hiroshima, four weeks after
Potsdam, U.S. President Truman issued a secret decree on secret service
interception, an information blockage on information machines. War­
determining cryptoanalysis became a matter of ultimate classified mate­
rial-in the past and the present, technology and method, successes and
results, Bletchley Park and Washington, D.C.226 As a result of which the
same, but now cold, war could start again immediately: in the shadow of
Truman's decree, COLOSSUS and its American clones learned Russian
instead of German. Hermetically sealed, "the legacy of a total war, and of
the capture of a total communications system, could now turn to the con­
struction of a total machine. " 227
The success of this strategy of dissimulation is proved by its only
leak. A writer, who not only knew the typewriter from secretaries but also
reproduced it on the printed page, communicated in letter form to the
warlords gathered in Potsdam that the symbolic has, through Enigma and
COLOSSUS, become a world of the machine.
